# Falcon BMS 4.35 - Israel 1980s Theater
It's a mod of the official Falcon BMS 4.35 Israel theater, optimized for 1980s-style operations by nerfing aircraft avionics and systems, as well as limiting available aircraft stores and SAM battalion capabilities.

## How to install?
* Download and install the official [Israel Theater Of Operations for BMS 4.35](https://www.benchmarksims.org/forum/showthread.php?40653-Israel-Theater-Of-Operations-for-BMS-4-35) (currently version v1.05 for BMS 4.35U1). This is required to use Israel 1980s, since it allows the latter to only require 200MB of disk space by referencing all other 8GB of terrain/texture files from the official Israel theater;

* Unzip "Add-On Israel1980s" into "Falcon BMS 4.35\Data\";

* Open the "Falcon BMS 4.35\Data\TerrData\TheaterDefinition\theater.lst" file and add the line "Add-On Israel1980s\Terrdata\theaterdefinition\Israel1980s.tdf";
