Also known as D-30, the 2A18 is a standard artillery piece found in most Russian-equipped armies. Simple and rugged, the weapon is relatively quick to take from march configuration into action. The weapon can fire a wide range of projectiles, including High-Explosive Anti-Tank Fin-Stabilized (HEAT-FS), HE Fragmentation (HE FRAG), Rocket-Assisted HE (HERA), smoke and illumination rounds. The D-30&apos;s HE FRAG shell creates a crater roughly ten feet in diameter and two-and-a-half feet deep. The shell has a lethality radius of about 18 yards against standing infantry and 10 yards against prone infantry. The D-30 barrel is also used on the M-1974 Self-propelled howitzer.

Designated M-1987 by the U.S. Army, the 2A65 &quot;Msta-B&quot; is a Soviet towed 152.4 mm howitzer. The &quot;B&quot; in the designation is an abbreviation for Buksiruyemaya, which means towed. This weapon has been fielded in Russian forces since at least 1987 and is currently in service with Russian front and army level artillery units. The 2A65 howitzer, like many pieces of modern artillery, is capable of firing nuclear artillery shells.
                
The 152 mm howitzer 2A65 (M1987) is mounted on a conventional split trail carriage and, when deployed in the firing position, rests on three points, the hydraulic circular firing jack under the forward part of the carriage and the two spades at the rear. Each of the box section trails has a caster wheel to assist the gun crew in bringing the weapon into action. When deployed in the firing position, these swing upwards through 180° and rest on top of each trail. The 152 mm ordnance is fitted with a muzzle brake and a semi-automatic breech mechanism, spring-operated ramming system, hydraulic counter-recoil device and a liquid-cooled recoil brake. Elevation and traverse is manual, two-speed, with the direct and indirect sighting devices being located on the left side of the weapon. Pneumatic brakes are fitted as standard.
                
The gun fires the same 152 mm ammunition types as the 152 mm 2S19 self-propelled artillery system and, more recently, a new family of separate loading (for example projectile and charge) 152 mm has been introduced. The standard OF45 high-explosive projectile weighs 43.56 kilograms, has a maximum muzzle velocity of 823 meters per second and a maximum range of 24.7 km. The charges include OF72 (long range), OF58 (full charge) and OF73 (reduced charge). The OF45 projectile can be fitted with different rear ends, for example various types of screw-on boat tails, or the OF61 base bleed projectile which weighs 42.86 kilograms, has a maximum muzzle velocity of 828 m/s and a maximum range of 29 km. The OF23 cargo projectile weighs 42.8 kg, has a maximum range of 26 kilometers and contains 42 High-Explosive Anti-Tank (HEAT) bomblets, each of which can penetrate 100 millimeters of conventional steel armour. Other types of projectile include the HS30 jamming round and the Russian 152 mm Krasnopol laser-guided projectile, which is covered in the entry for the 2S19 self-propelled artillery system. A 155 mm version of this system has been developed but as far as it is known this has not been exported. China has developed a new 155 mm/52 calibre SP artillery system called the PLZ52. This has a turret very similar to the 2S19. In addition to these new 152 mm projectiles the 2A65 can fire all standard types of 152 mm ammunition fired by the older Russian D-20 towed gun-howitzer and the 2S3 self-propelled gun-howitzer.

Designated M-1974 by the U.S. Army, the 2S1 Gvozdika has the largest caliber gun mounted on any amphibious chassis. The Russian designation for the weapon is the 2S1 Gvozdika (Carnation). The gun is the most common tracked artillery weapon in the Russian army. Because the M-1974 is self-propelled, a battery of the weapons can set up, carry out its fire mission and move to a new location before counter-battery return fire can find its mark. The gun can fire High Explosive Fragmentation (HE-FRAG), Rocket-Assisted HE (HERA), Fin-Stabilized HE Anti-Tank (HEAT-FS) and a variety of smoke, illumination and chemical rounds.

Designated M-1973 by the U.S. Army, the 2S3 was the first self-propelled artillery made by the Soviet Union after World War II. It consists of a large turret mounted on an AFV frame, but unlike many Soviet built AFVs, it isn&apos;t amphibious. The extreme mobility of this weapon makes it far deadlier than standard artillery. It takes less time to set in position, and it can move after firing a small barrage, making it extremely difficult to zero in on. Also, this weapon is capable of firing a wide range of ammunition, including HE rounds, rocket-assisted ordnance, anti-armor rounds capable of penetrating five inches of plate armor, and possibly chemical rounds as well.
                
The 2S3 is used by members of the former Soviet Union as well as several former Soviet allies.

Firing a larger shell than any other self-propelled artillery, the M-1975 fires a 286 lb. high-explosive round over considerable distance, causing much destruction.     
While this vehicle has tremendous offensive abilities, it does have some drawbacks. Because of the size and force of the mortar, the weapon can only be fired with the crew outside of the vehicle. Furthermore, the size of the shells makes it capable of firing only one shot per minute. It is also very big and slow, making it an easy target from the air.
                
The 2S4s crew consist of a driver and the commander, plus an additional 3 support troops are needed to operate the mortar. The additional troops are usually carried by a separate armored personnel carrier.

The 2S19 is a lightly armored SP artillery unit mounted on a T-80 chassis, including the standard dozer blade. Its weapon has an incredible range that is made even more deadly by its ability to fire up to eight rounds per minute. Furthermore, it is capable of being loaded with ammunition from the outside, allowing it to fire from a prepared position and move on without having to reload.
                
The 2S19 has a longer range than any U.S. artillery piece.

The best known of the Russian mobile battery command posts is the 54K6 series, associated with the S-300PS/PM/PMU SA-10 Grumble and S-300PMU1/PMU2 SA-20 Gargoyle Surface to Air Missile systems.
                
The 54K6E is mobile command post mounted on an 8x8 truck system or a tracked chassis (S-300V). Each S-300 battalion/system includes a 54K6E command post. This command post entered service along with the S-300 air defense system in 1978.
                
The 83M6E and 83M6E2 combat management centers introduced in the 1980s and 1990s are intended to link up to six S-300PMU2 or S-300PMU1 air defense systems into a single air defense system providing a six-fold combined engagement capability.
                
The 54K6 family of mobile battery command posts first appeared during the 1980s as part of the high mobility S-300PS / SA-10B Grumble B SAM system. The design combined a command post cabin with a MAZ-7910 chassis, and included a telescoping mast for the radio datalink which networked all of the battery elements. The design progressively evolved as the S-300P family of missiles evolved. The final variants of this system provided significant integration capabilities, with the ability to network the battery 30N6E2 engagement radars, and some legacy SAM engagement radars. The 83M6E2 designation is reserved for a paired 64N6E2 Big Bird acquisition radar and a 54K6E2 command post.
                
A typical operational architecture will see the 54K6E2 networked with a Polyana TsM sector command post, to provide bidirectional transfer of target data.

The Soviet recoil-operated 37mm antiaircraft guns are based on a Bofors design and closely resemble the 40mm guns used in both the British and United States forces during World Mar II. Although the single mount is the most common version, a twin mount was produced and has been exported to Algeria. The Soviet Navy also employed a twin water-cooled version closely resembling the multi-mount United States 40mm guns used in World War II. The 37nm guns have hydraulic recoil buffers and spring recuperators. The breech blocks are of the rising block type. The field mobile weapon may be equipped with a shield. There is no provision for radar fire control. The 37mm gun M1939 is used in Communist China where it is known as the Type 55.
                
The Soviet Navy purchased a number of Bofors 25 mm Model 1933 guns in 1935, trials of the weapon were successful and it was decided to develop a 45 mm version of the weapon designated the 49-K. The development under the guidance of leading Soviet designers M. N. Loginov, I. A. Lyamin and L. V. Lyuliev was successful, but the army thought that the 45 mm calibre was a little too large for an automatic field weapon. In January 1938 the Artillery Factory Number 8 in Sverdlovsk was ordered to develop a 37 mm weapon based on the same design. The task was fulfilled by the chief designer of the factory, Mikhail Loginov, and his assistant Lev Loktev. Firing trials of the new 61-K were conducted in October 1938.
                
Competitive firing trials were conducted in 1940 between the 61-K and the Bofors 40 mm/56. There were no substantial differences found between them.

The A-6 Intruder was initially designed to deliver conventional or nuclear weapons in low-visibility weather conditions, and to this end, came outfitted with all-weather navigation systems. The Intruder also possesses exceptional endurance and can deliver a larger payload than previous carrier-based attack bombers.
The A-6E, first flown in early 1970, was an advanced conversion adding a multimode radar and advanced computing capabilities. A-6Es proved their worthiness in the 1986 Libyan Strike, evading enemy radars and guided missiles. The release of the A-6E/TRAM (Target Recognition Attack Multisensor) in 1974 improved the onboard sensors by adding a turreted electro-optical sensor package. The TRAM model installs additional augmentations, the most notable being INS enhancements and provisions for the Condor missile.

While many pilots consider the &quot;Warthog&quot; to be the ugliest thing in the air, the sight of an A-10 terrifies any enemy ground units that are unfortunate enough to encounter one--and with good reason. This craft carries a large load of ordnance, yet its deadliest weapon is the GAU-8/A cannon, which destroys whatever it hits. However, this gun can only fire short bursts, because the recoil it produces is greater than the thrust of the aircraft&apos;s engines. The Warthog&apos;s only saving graces in air-to-air combat are its tight turning radius, thick armor and ability to fly at extremely low altitude; even the bravest fighter pilots have no wish to drop to 50 feet to chase the A-10. The A-10 pilot&apos;s technique of making a fast turnabout and following up with a burst of GAU-8/A fire is called the &quot;Warthog stomp&quot; for good reason. A wise interceptor pilot will simply attack from above, where the A-10 cannot defend itself. For this reason, Warthog pilots depend on good air cover to complete their missions.
                
There has been considerable controversy over the A-10&apos;s survivability in a high-threat environment, and since the Cold War has ended, the question may never be resolved. The Warthog proved its worth during the Gulf War, however, flying 8,100 sorties and destroying more than 1,000 tanks, 2,000 military vehicles and 1,200 artillery pieces. The aircraft also proved that it is capable of flying more mission types than just Close Air Support missions. A-10s were tasked with Forward Air Control, Armed Reconnaissance, Wild Weasel and BAI. The Warthog even scored a few A-A kills on Iraqi helicopters.
                
Five A-10s were shot down during the war. Twenty were significantly damaged, of which nineteen returned to service after field repairs.

The A-50 &quot;Mainstay&quot; is actually a variant of the IL-76 &quot;Candid.&quot; However, there are considerable differences between the two aircraft. The most obvious difference is the large saucer-shaped radome over the A-50&apos;s rear fuselage. This craft also boasts a comprehensive ECM system, midair refueling capabilities and an improved IFF system. The Mainstay functions much like the U.S. AWACS aircraft: it provides early warning and detection of missiles and low-flying aircraft, and directs fighter operations in air combat situations. These aircraft are among the highest priority targets you will ever encounter. Destroy them whenever possible. While they have no real defenses themselves, they are perfectly capable of sending a large number of fighters to intercept you, making it imperative that you take them out quickly.

In 1955 the Kaliningrad (Moscow Oblast) Series Production Plant, which was producing gun turrets for M-4 bomber aircraft and similar equipment, began series production of the first K-5 and K-8 guided air-to-air missiles.
                
The R-55 (K-55, Object 67), a modification of the K-5 missile, was series-produced throughout the 1967-77 period and quite widely used. By then the Almaz team had given up work air-to-air missiles, and the development of the K-55 missile was assigned to the engineering office at the Kaliningrad (Moscow Oblast) Series Production Plant. This plant was producing aircraft weapons (artillery turrets for M-4 bomber aircraft, sights, etc.), then in 1955 began series production of the first K-5 and K-8 guided air-to-air missiles. Developing the K-55 missile was the first task ever assigned to this team alone (and the only one concerning air-to-air missiles in the history of this team). Currently this engineering office in Kaliningrad, under the name Zvezda, is the leading Russian creator of strategic guided air-to-ground missiles.
                
During the 1966-168 period the two teams working on air-to-air missiles were renamed, Bisnovat&apos;s OKB-4 team was renamed Molniya and Andrey Lyapin&apos;s (who replaced Ivan Toropov in 1961) team was designated Vympel. During later part of the 1960s the Vympel team began working on modifications to the R-55 which resulted in the R-55M missile, with a cooled homing head, a radio rather than optical closing-in igniter, and a more potent warhead. The PL-1 [Pili = Thunderbolt, or Pen Lung = Air Dragon] medium range air-to-air missile was a Chinese copy of the AA-1.

The K-13 series of missiles were reverse engineered from an AIM-9 missile that was lodged in a Mig-17 in 1958. The K-13 was produced in China as the PL-2.
                
While the R-3S was being introduced in 1961, work started on a semi-active radar homing (SARH) version for high-altitude use, the K-13R (R-3R or Object 320) with 8 km range, similar to the little-used US Navy AIM-9C Sidewinder (carried by the F-8 Crusader). This took longer to develop, and did not enter service until 1966. This version was designated AA-2B by NATO.
                
Later versions: The AA-2D (K-13R) version of the missile was produced later and considered an Advanced Atoll.
                
Most of the aircraft that carry this weapon have difficultly locking targets with background clutter. The exception is the Su-15. Defeat the launching aircraft&apos;s radar with ECM or by getting below the horizon. A 4g break turn with chaff and beaming the missile can also be effective.

The K-13M version of the missile was produced later and considered an Advanced Atoll. It has a more range and a more sensitive nitrogen cooled seeker head than its older versions.
                
Most of the aircraft that carry this weapon have difficultly locking targets with background clutter. The exception is the Su-15. Make it more difficult for the launching aircraft to detect you by getting below the horizon. Reducing throttle and a 4g break turn with flares may be effective if the missile is launched.

In early 1962 the Bisnovat design team began working on the R-40 (K-40)or AA-6, a new long-range missile intended for use with the the MiG-25-40 high- altitude interception system, consisting of the MiG-25 aircraft with Smerch-A radar set and the R-40 missile. Though only slightly larger than the predecessor R-4, the range of the R-40 is over three times greater. This missile was produced in two variants: R-40R (Object RD46 with PARG-12 head) and R-40T (Object TG-46).
                
After the defection of a MiG-25P to Japan on 06 September 1976, an extensive redesign of the aircraft was undertaken, resulting in the MiG-25PD interception system. Instead of the Smerch-A, a Sapfir-25 radar was installed. The new missile R-40D and its R-40D1 update (&quot;dorabotanaya&quot; [more elaborate]) were produced in two variants R-40RD and R-40TD, both featuring improved countermeasures resistance and a more sensitive homing head to improve performance against low-flying targets. The R-40D1 missile was developed by the Vympel team, the Molniya team having by that time withdraw from development of aircraft missiles. The R-40 is still included among the weapons of MiG-25 and MiG-31 aircraft, although production was discontinued in 1991.

The SARH AA-7 version is roughly equivalent to the AIM-7 Sparrow in range and capability. The Apex also comes in an all-aspect infrared version. Russian tactical doctrine calls for ripple firing two of these missiles to increase the probability of a kill. Often both an infrared and a radar version are launched within a three second interval.
                
The AA-7 has not demonstrated strong combat performance. Syrian MiGs firing AA-7s failed to score against the Israeli Air Force during the 1982 invasion of Lebanon. The missile&apos;s sole victim is a South African Mirage F1 when fired by an Angolan MiG-23.
                
The AA-7 can be defeated at long range by notching to the beam, with or without ECM and chaff. At closer range, ECM, chaff, flares and a break inside the missile&apos;s turn radius might be necessary.

In the mid-1960s the Vympel design bureau developed the K-23 intermediate-range missile for MiG-23 fighter jet aircraft. While the first units of the K-23 missile were tested with the prototypes the MiG-23 aircraft, the missile was certified as a weapon for the MiG-23M in 1973. The R-23 comes in two variants: R-23R (Object 340) with radar guidance and R-23T (Object 360) with infrared guidance. There is also the training version R-23UT.
                
The later MiG-23ML and MiG-23MLD aircraft carry the R-24 missile, a modification of the R-23 with various improved characteristics, most importantly increased range. In its external appearance this missile is similar to the predecessor R-23. For actual use it is available in two variants: R-24R (Object 140) and R-24T (Object 160).
                
The R-23 is produced in Romania under license as the A-911.
In 1968 the Soviets acquired an American AIM-7M Sparrow, which was similar to the R-23 class of missiles the under development, and the Vympel team copied the Sparrow under the designation K-25. Several of these missiles were tested, but Soviet R-23 missile was sent to production, and work on the K-25 ended in 1971. The R-23 and R-24 missiles were superior to the K-25 Sparrow-ski in versatility and range, as well as interference immunity, signal processing logic, and other characteristics. Nevertheless, analysis of the Sparrow missile design were helpful in later work on the R-27 missile: on its hydraulically driven closed-loop servomechanisms and aerodynamic system with movable wings.

The AA-8 Aphid was the first Russian missile designed specifically for dogfighting. The missile uses a peltier-cooled IR detector for all-aspect capability and a high tracking rate to follow targets maneuvering at up to 8G. The seeker also has ±20° gimbal limits allowing shots farther off boresight than earlier missiles.
                
The missile can be launched from a fighter maneuvering at up to 9G. To achieve this maneuverability, the missile&apos;s designers traded range and size. As a result, the Aphid must get within a few feet of its target to have a good chance of causing serious damage.
                
The AA-8 has not demonstrated strong combat performance. Syrian MiGs firing AA-8s failed to score against the Israeli Air Force during the 1982 invasion of Lebanon.

		<DescriptionData>
The AA-9 is a long-range Semi-Active Radar-Homing (SARH) missile closely integrated with the MiG-31 fire control radar. Similar in concept to the F-14/Phoenix weapon system, the MiG-31 can engage and launch on four independent targets. The missile is primarily designed to attack bombers and cruise missiles and is incapable of maneuvering with most modern fighters. (This doesn&apos;t mean the threat can be ignored, however, since it carries a large enough warhead that even a near-miss can be fatal).
                
The missile has never been used in combat, but test firings from above 20,000ft have successfully intercepted high speed targets flying at 200ft.
                
The usual techniques of putting the radar illuminator on the beam, ECM and chaff followed by a hard break into the missile should work.

The R-27 is a medium range air to air missile designed for the Soviet Union&apos;s 4th generation fighters. The R-27R (AA-10A) is the semi active radar homing version of the AA10. The main radar missile of the MiG29.
                
The missile uses inertial guidance with data link commands from the launching aircraft in the first phase of the flight. The missile uses a modular design and can be converted from IR to SARH by replacing the seeker module. The Alamo is not really a dogfight missile, but can follow a target pulling up to 8 Gs-good enough for anything but a top-of-the-line fighter operating at its maximum turn performance. Russian tactical doctrine is based on firing two air-to-air missiles with differing seekers to increase the chance of a kill.
                
At long range, the missile can be evaded with a maneuver to the beam, ECM and chaff. At close range, a 9G turn into the missile should work.

The R-27 is a medium range air to air missile designed for the Soviet Union&apos;s 4th generation fighters. The R-27ET (AA-10D) is the all aspect Infrared homing version of the AA-10 with better range.
                
The missile uses inertial guidance with data link commands from the launching aircraft in the first phase of the flight. The missile uses a modular design and can be converted from IR to SARH by replacing the seeker module. The Alamo is not really a dogfight missile, but can follow a target pulling up to 8 Gs-good enough for anything but a top-of-the-line fighter operating at its maximum turn performance. Russian tactical doctrine is based on firing two air-to-air missiles with differing seekers to increase the chance of a kill.
                
To evade the missile at long range, reduce throttle and dispense flares. At closer ranges, use a 9g break turn and 4-5 flares.

		<DescriptionData>
The original R-73 was manufactured by Vympel and had a 40° off boresight seeker. It was later upgraded to the R-73M standard giving it more range, wider 60° off boresight seeker and an improved seeker with IRCCM. The R-73M entered service in 1997. The BMS version of the Archer more closely resembles the R-73M.
                
It is very maneuverable with its thrust vectoring and capable of targeting aircraft up to 60° off boresight with a helmet mounted site. Combine that with the angle of attack provided by its thrust vectoring and it can maneuver to follow targets approximately 110° off its flight path. It is more capable than any other heat seeking missile of its time and motivated the west to improve their own missile designs.
                
Evading the R-73 is very difficult and it is best to avoid getting into its firing envelope. The seeker range can be limited to 9nm (17km) by staying out of after burner. If you are unlucky enough to be inside the envelope of one, reduce throttle, dispense as many flares as you can and break into the missile.

The R-77 is similar to the AIM-120. Vestigial cruciform wings with grid fins used as tail control surfaces give it excellent maneuverability. There is no launch warning from an F-16 RWR when fired on. The only warning may be a lock tone if the launching aircraft locks you up before firing. Outside of 12nm the missile uses inertial guidance and encoded data link updates from the launching aircraft&apos;s radar. When within 12nm, the missile&apos;s active seeker takes over guidance. The seeker uses a multi-function doppler monopulse active radar. The launching aircraft can continue to give the missile target information if the missile radar lock is broke.
                
Use a jammer to deny a radar lock and limit the range that the missile can be fired from. Su-30MKK aircraft and up can burn through at about 30nm. But the others can be limited to about 15nm with a jammer. Once within the burn through range, turn the jammer off. The R-77 loses a lot of speed after about 10nm and can be successfully dragged with a crank and pump maneuver if executed early enough. The active missile seeker warning from the RWR will give notice that the missile is 12nm or closer.

The Mitsubishi AAM-4 is a medium-range active radar homing air-to-air missile, considered as modern beyond-visual-range missile developed in Japan and intended to replace the semi-active radar homing AIM-7 Sparrow missile in service. It has been operational since 1999. The main contractor is Mitsubishi Electric.
                
The improved AAM-4B was the world&apos;s first air-to-air missile with an AESA radar seeker. The AAM-4B entered production in 2010 for service on the F-15J and F-2, but it is too large to be carried in the weapons bay of the F-35 Lightning II. So on 17 July 2014 Japan announced a collaboration with the United Kingdom to study the development of a new Joint New Air-to-Air Missile (JNAAM). MBDA UK is prime contractor on the Meteor missile which entered service on the Saab JAS 39 Gripen in 2016 and on the Eurofighter Typhoon and Dassault Rafale in 2018, and can fit in the internal weapons bay of the F-35. It has a unique variable-flow ramjet motor that according to MBDA gives the Meteor the largest no-escape zone of any air-to-air missile. The JNAAM will combine the UK&apos;s missile-related technologies and Japanese seeker technologies&quot;, possibly with some adjustments to help the missile fit better in the F-35 weapons bay.

AAV-7A1
The AAV-7A1 is currently the largest armored personnel carrier (APC) anywhere. It is the primary amphibious beach landing vehicle of the U.S. Marines, able to land in 10-foot surf. It carries a large load of troops and enough firepower to provide suitable cover fire against anything short of heavy armor and ground attack aircraft.
                
AAV-C7A1
The AAVC7A1 is the command variant of the AAV7A1, and it is similar in many ways except for its added communications and electronic equipment, and its lack of weaponry. It is capable of secured ship-to-shore communications and is equipped with a five-operator communications center.

The AC-130H Spectre gunship&apos;s primary missions are close air support, air interdiction and armed reconnaissance. Other missions include perimeter and point defense, escort, landing, drop and extraction zone support, forward air control, limited command and control, and combat search and rescue.
                
These heavily armed aircraft incorporate side-firing weapons integrated with sophisticated sensor, navigation and fire control systems to provide surgical firepower or area saturation during extended periods, at night and in adverse weather.
                
During Vietnam, gunships destroyed more than 10,000 trucks and were credited with many life-saving close air support missions. AC-130s suppressed enemy air defense systems and attacked ground forces during Operation Urgent Fury in Grenada. This enabled the successful assault of Point Salines airfield via airdrop and airland of friendly forces.
                
The gunships had a primary role during Operation Just Cause in Panama by destroying Panamanian Defense Force Headquarters and numerous command and control facilities by surgical employment of ordnance in an urban environment. As the only close air support platform in the theater, Spectres were credited with saving the lives of many friendly personnel.
                
During Operation Desert Storm, Spectres provided air base defense and close air support for ground forces. AC-130s were also used during Operations Continue Hope and United Shield in Somalia, providing close air support for United Nations ground forces. The gunships have most recently played a pivotal role during operations in support of the NATO mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina, providing air interdiction against key targets in the Sarajevo area.
                
The AC-130 is an excellent fire support platform with outstanding capabilities. With its extremely accurate fire control system, the AC-130 can place 105mm, 40mm and 25mm munitions on target with first round accuracy. The crew of these aircraft are extremely proficient working in military operations in urban terrain [MOUT] environments.
                
The Air Force commemorated the end of an era 10 September 1995 with the retirement of the first C-130 aircraft to come off a production line. The aircraft, tail number 53-3129, went into production at the Lockheed Aircraft Co. in Marietta, Ga., in 1953 and was the original prototype of what was to become a long line of C-130 Hercules aircraft designed and built by Lockheed. The aircraft, affectionately dubbed &quot;The First Lady,&quot; was one of five AC-130A gunship aircraft retired during an official ceremony. While the other four aircraft were sent to the Aerospace Marketing and Regeneration Center at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, the First Lady went on permanent display at the Eglin Air Force Base Armament Museum. The 919th Special Operations Wing&apos;s gunships, all around 40 years old, had reached the age of mandatory retirement. The only other gunships in the Air Force inventory are employed by active-duty members at Hurlburt Field, which has less than 20 gunships assigned.
                
The AC-130H ALQ-172 ECM Upgrade installs and modifies the ALQ-172 with low band jamming capability for all AC-130H aircraft. It also modifies the ALQ-172 with engineering change proposal-93 to provide increased memory and flight line reprogramming capabilities. The Air Force [WR-ALC/LUKA] issued a sole source, fixed price contract, to International Telephone &amp; Telegraph (ITT) for development of low band jammer and subsequent production. Issue a competitive, firm fixed price contract for the Group A modifications (preparing aircraft to receive jammers).
                
Currently funded weight reduction and center of gravity (CG) improvements to the AC-130H aircraft include: redesign of 40mm and 105mm ammo racks using lighter weight materials; reverse engineering of 40mm and 105mm trainable gun mounts using lighter weight material; and removal of non-critical armor. These efforts are performed by a sole source contract awarded to Rock Island Arsenal.

The MT-LBu is a Soviet multi-purpose fully amphibious armoured carrier which was developed under the factory index Ob&apos;yekt 10 in the late 1960s, based on the MT-LB. It has a more powerful engine, a 40 cm higher hull and a longer chassis with 7 road wheels on each side.
                
The crew - a driver and a commander - is located in a compartment at the front of the vehicle, with the engine behind them. The compartment at the rear has a volume of 13 m³. A load of 6,500 kg can be towed. The vehicle is fully amphibious, being propelled in the water by its tracks.
                
The vehicle is lightly armoured against small arms and shell splinters with a thickness of 3 to 10 mm of steel. The troop compartment has one roof hatch over the top, which opens rearwards. In the centre of the roof there is a big circular opening that is covered with a blanking plate with hatch when no turret is mounted. The MT-LBu has only 2 firing ports: one in the front right side, the other in the rear door, both with an associated vision device.
                
The driver is provided with a TVN-2 infra-red periscope, which in combination with the OU-3GK infra-red/white light search light provides a range of about 40 m. The MT-LBu is equipped with an NBC detection device GO-27, a filter system FVU and a navigation apparatus.

The AGM-12 Bullpup is an air-to-ground missile which was used on the A-4 Skyhawk, A-6 Intruder, F-105 Thunderchief, F-4 Phantom II, F-8 Crusader, and P-3 Orion in U.S. service and on numerous other NATO and Allied aircraft. It was superseded by more advanced weapons, notably the AGM-62 Walleye and AGM-65 Maverick.
                       
The Bullpup had a Manual Command Line Of Sight guidance system with roll-stabilization. In flight the pilot or weapons operator tracked the Bullpup by watching a flare on the back of the missile and used a control joystick to steer it toward the target using radio signals. It was initially powered by a solid fuel rocket motor, and carried a 250 lb (110 kg) warhead.
                
After launching the Bullpup, best accuracy was maintained by continuing to fly the same track, so that the pilot could sight down the smoke trail and steer the missile from directly behind as much as possible. Unfortunately, one problem quickly discovered by pilots in Vietnam was that gunners on the ground could simply fire at the smoke trail of the missile's flare and have a fairly good chance of hitting the aircraft that had launchedand was still guidingthe missile. Thus, to try to protect their own aircraft, the pilot would &quot;jig&quot; slightly off of the missile's path and hopefully avoid the anti-aircraft fire.

The Bullpup was the U.S. Navy and the USAF&apos;s first successful guided tactical air-to-ground missile. It&apos;s development was a direct reaction to the frustration of the US Navy with unguided weapons during the Korean War. The two primary goals were to increas the probability of destroying targets which are hard to hit with general purpose bombs, like bridges, and to minimize exposure to enemy ground fire. Martin won the contract and the ASM-N-7 Bullpup entered service in the US Navy in 1959.
                      
The ASM-N-7 was roll-stabilized, a simple standard 250lbs bomb was adapted as the warhead and it was powered by an Aerojet MK8 solid fuel motor. Two flares in the back of the missile allowed the pilot to optically track the missile and guide it to the target using a small control stick to transmit radio control commands. The main drawback was that the target, the missile and the launching aircraft had to remain in a straight line during guidance. That made the aircraft a vulnerable target for ground fire which was one thing to avoid as per the primary design goals.
                      
US Air Force started its involvement in the Bullpup around 1955 with the goal of having a nuclear capable version of the Bullpup. The AGM-12D resulted which could optionally be armed with a 1-15kt W-45 fission warhead. For training a 5in rocket with tracking flares and radio guidance were developed.
                       
In june 1963 all Bullpup versions were redesignated as the AGM-12 series. Over 30000 missiles where built mostly AGM-12A/B and the phase-out began in mid 1970s. The last AGM-12C were retired in the early 1980s.

The Shrike was developed by the Naval Weapons Center at China Lake in 1963. It is an antiradiation missile designed to home in on hostile anti-aircraft radars. Several versions of the radar exist, each covering a different part of the RF spectrum. The fixed seeker frequency coverage limits the operational flexibility of the weapon since each missile can only attack specific radar systems. In addition, the Shrike will go ballistic if the target radar shuts down before the missile impacts.
                
Shrikes were used extensively in Vietnam. The Israeli Air Force has also employed Shrike missiles effectively in various wars with the Arab states. 78 Shrikes were fired during Operation Desert Storm. The Shrike has been replaced by the HARM in the U.S. Air Force inventory.
                
The Shrike was first employed during the Vietnam War by the Navy in 1965 using A-4 aircraft. The Air Force adopted the weapon the following year using F-105F and G Thunderchief Wild Weasel SEAD aircraft, and later the F-4 Phantom II in the same role. The range was nominally shorter than the SA-2 Guideline missiles that the system was used against, although it was a great improvement over the early method of attacking SAM sites with rockets and bombs from F-100F Super Sabres. A Shrike was typically lofted about 30 degrees above the horizon at a Fan Song radar some 15 miles (25 km) away for a flight time of 50 seconds. Tactics changed incrementally over the campaigns of 1966 and 1967 until the advent of the AGM-78 Standard ARM. That new weapon allowed launches from significantly longer range with a much easier attack profile, as the STARM could be launched up to 180 degrees off target and still expect a hit and its speed allowed it to travel faster than the SA-2. Even after the AGM-78 entered service, the Weasels still carried the Shrike because the STARM cost about $200,000, while a Shrike cost only $7,000. If USAF pilots expended an STARM they would have to fill out a lengthy form during debriefing. A somewhat standard load for the F-105G was a 650 US gal (2,500 L) centerline fuel tank, two AGM-78s on inboard pylons and two Shrikes on the outboards. The mix varied slightly for jamming pods and the occasional AIM-9 Sidewinder but this was the baseline.[citation needed]
                
Shrike was involved in a friendly fire incident during a 15 April 1972 airstrike on Haiphong. Two missiles struck USS Worden (CG-18) killing one crewman and injuring nine more. An American pilot apparently interpreted the PIRAZ cruiser&apos;s AN/SPG-55 radar as a North Vietnamese SAM site. Worden required ten days shipyard work at the Subic Bay Naval Base to repair the damage.
                
Although the Shrike missile did not enter regular service with the United Kingdom, it was supplied to the RAF for use in the Falklands War of 1982. RAF Shrikes were fitted to modified Vulcan bombers in order to attack Argentine radar installations during Operation Black Buck. The main target was a Westinghouse AN/TPS-43 long range 3D radar that the Argentine Air Force deployed during April to guard Falklands&apos; airspace. The Argentine operators were aware of the anti-radiation missiles and would simply turn it off during the Vulcan&apos;s approaches. This radar remained intact during the whole conflict. However, air defences remained operational during the attacks and the Shrikes hit two of the less valuable and rapidly replaced secondary fire control radars. Also, following a Vulcan making an emergency landing at Rio de Janeiro, Brazilian authorities confiscated one Shrike which was not returned.
                
About 95 AGM-45s were used in 1991 during Desert Storm against Iraqi air defense, mostly by F-4Gs.
                
The Shrike&apos;s limitations are characterized primarily in the fact that subvariants abound, each tuned to a different radar band. Angle gating, used to prioritize targets, was included in every subvariant of the AGM-45A and B after the A-2 and B-2. It was also slow and the lack of punch in the warhead made it difficult for bomb damage assessment, as well as inflicting any damage to the Fan Song Radar vans beyond a shattered radar dish, an easy item to replace or repair. The short range, combined with its lack of speed (compared to the SA-2 SAM) made for a difficult attack. The missile had to be well within the range of the SAM radar and if a SAM was fired the SAM would get to the aircraft first. Also the missile had few tolerances and had to be launched no more than + or - 3 degrees from the target[citation needed]. Many pilots in Vietnam did not like the Shrike because of its limitations and its success rate of around 25%.
                
The differences between the AGM-45A and B are in the rocket motor used, and in the warheads capable of being fitted. The AGM-45A used the Rocketdyne Mk 39 Mod 0 (or apparently in some cases the Aerojet Mk 53 Mod 1) motor, while the AGM-45B used Aerojet Mk 78 Mod 0 which greatly increased the range of the missile. As for warheads, the Mk 5 Mod 0, Mk 86 Mod 0, and WAU-8/B could all be fitted to the AGM-45A and were all blast-fragmentation in nature. The AGM-45B made use of the improved Mk 5 Mod 1 and Mk 86 Mod 1 warheads, as well as, the WAU-9/B, again all blast-fragmentation in type.

The AGM-62 WALLEYE is a guided glide bomb designed to be delivered on a surface target from an attack aircraft. It is used primarily against targets such as fuel tanks, tunnels, bridges, radar sites, port facilities, and ammunition depots. The weapon system consists of the weapon, the attack aircraft, the AN/AWW-9B data link pod, and the OK-293/AWW control group. The WALLEYE is unique in that it has no propulsion section and must rely on its ability to glide to the target after release from the aircraft. There are three basic series of the WALLEYE weapon. The original WALLEYE I Extended Range Data Link (ERDL) utilizes a tone data link system while the newer version utilizes the differential phase shift keyed digital data link, designed to prevent signal jamming. The WALLEYE II and WALLEYE II ERDL are greater in diameter, length, and weight than the WALLEYE I ERDL weapons. The AGM- 62 designation for Walleye nomenclature is not in wide use.
China Lake designed and developed the first precision-guided antisurface weapon, the Walleye (AGM-62) TV-guided glide bomb. Related to Walleye but cancelled before completion was Condor (AGM-53), a rocket-powered TV-guided missile. Extended-range data links have also been developed for Walleye. China Lake also developed Bulldog (AGM-83), the first successful laser-guided missile, which was approved for service use in 1974 but cancelled in favor of the Air Force Maverick.
In January 1963 a Walleye television glide bomb, released from a YA-4B, made a direct impact on its target at the Naval Ordnance Test Station, China Lake in the first demonstration of its automatic homing feature. A contract for production of the Walleye television homing glide bomb was issued to the Martin Marietta Corporation in January 1966. An outgrowth of in-house China Lake technology efforts, Walleye was fielded in 1967 and proved its unsurpassed accuracy in combat.
Originally developed by the Navy, the Air Force began Walleye combat tests in Vietnam during August 1967 that achieved excellent results in good visibility against targets that gave a strong contrast and were lightly defended. Later Walleye operations in more demanding conditions were less successful. It continued to be used in Southeast Asia, but due to its operating restrictions, cost, and the appearance of laser-guided bombs (LGB), comprised only a small fraction (6 percent) of the total number of PGMs
employed in Vietnam.
The ERDL weapon provides distinct advantages over the standard WALLEYE. With the ERDL version, the added data link permits the weapon to continue to send a video target display from launch of the weapon until target impact. The data link further allows the controlling aircraft to control the weapon in flight and to either retarget or redefine the target aim point. The controlling aircraft can be the launching aircraft or a second aircraft equipped with a data link pod (AN/AWW-9B).
The 1427-1435 MHz band is used for proficiency training using various guided weapon systems. The weapon systems and supporting data links that operate in this band include the AWW-13 Advanced Data Link, used in the Walleye and SLAM. The current Navy inventory includes approximately 200 Walleye
and 800 SLAM weapon systems. The loss of this band for missile command operations would render Navy systems more susceptible to jamming and will impair their terminal guidance. Compounding the problem are developmental weapons, such as the Joint Standoff Weapon Unitary (JSOW Unitary), that will use the AWW-13. The AWW-13 requires spectrum for both command and video functions.
                
Electro-optical [EO] sensors such as used on Walleye depend on both light and optical contrast for target searching and identification. This obviates their use at night and in significantly adverse weather or visual conditions where the line of sight to a target was obscured. The requirement for visual contrast between
the target and its immediate surroundings imposed problems during Desert Storm. For Walleye delivery, F/A-18 pilots reported that a target was sometimes indistinguishable from its own shadow. This made it difficult to reliably designate the actual target, rather than its shadow, for a true weapon hit. The the lowlight conditions at dawn and dusk often provided insufficient light for the required degree of optical contrast. A &quot;haze penetrator&quot; version of Walleye used low-light optics to see through daytime haze and at dawn and dusk, permitting use in some of the conditions in which other optical systems were limited.
                
The SLAM is based on the highly successful and reliable Harpoon anti-ship missile, with a Global Positioning System-aided Inertial Navigation System (GPS/INS) for mid-course guidance, and a Maverick imaging infrared sensor and a Walleye data link for precise, man-in-the-loop terminal guidance.

The AGM-65 Maverick is a standoff air-to-ground missile designed primarily as an anti-armor weapon, but is also capable of striking a variety of surface targets. The missile provides launch-and-leave capability to attack aircraft performing close air support, interdiction and defense suppression missions. First operational in 1972, several variants of the Maverick have been fielded both to incorporate improvements in technology and to accommodate special mission requirements.
                
A Model		 
The A model Maverick uses an electro-optical television seeker head. When commanded to lock, the missile&apos;s computer analyzes the scene to pick out a target from the background using contrast and edge detection. After lock-on, the target area and the background are continually sampled to determine if the target is still in the center of the scene. If the target moves or the missile line of sight drifts, the camera is slewed to recenter the target. The missile control surfaces then steer the missile back into alignment with the camera and back on a collision course with the target. As the missile closes on the target, the target&apos;s apparent size will increase. To compensate, the guidance unit continually redefines the target boundaries to include an ever-increasing area.
                
The A, B and D model Mavericks all use a contact fuze and a shaped charge warhead effective against all known armored vehicles.
About 5,000 Mavericks have been fired in combat, with a success rate of 90%.
                
Engagement Sequence
The first step in Maverick employment is to point the missile&apos;s seeker at the target. Depending on the avionics of the launching fighter, the Maverick seeker can be steered visually, slaved to a ground map radar or slaved to a laser detector. Once the missile is looking at or near the desired target, the pilot commands the missile to stabilize. The missile locks on autonomously once it is stabilized and detects a valid target. If necessary, the seeker can be slewed manually between stabilization and lock-on. Care must be taken that the lock is solid enough to survive post-launch transients. Once fired, the missile falls a few hundred feet below the launch point, then, as its rocket motor kicks in, it does an range-optimizing zoom climb to strike its target from above. The minimum slant range to avoid fragments from the missile blast is 3500 ft at 400 knots (assuming a 4-G wings-level pullout).

D Model
The D model uses a an imaging infrared detector to provide a thermal view of the target, but otherwise uses the same principles for target detection and tracking. An IR image allows the missile to be used in darkness, under hazy conditions and during bad weather. The A, B and D model Mavericks all use a contact fuze and a shaped charge warhead effective against all known armored vehicles.
About 5,000 Mavericks have been fired in combat, with a success rate of 90%.

G Model
The G model uses the same Imaging IR seeker as the D model, but is designed for use against bunkers. To this end it carries a delayed fuse and a penetrator warhead. Its target recognition software has also been optimized for detecting larger targets.
                
E Model
The E model is deployed by the USMC. It incorporates a laser homing seeker that allows ground forces to designate the targets they want destroyed. This alleviates some of the pilot workload associated with finding and firing on ground targets and helps ensure that the desired targets are hit.
                
F Model
The F model is physically the same as the G model, but its software has been optimized for tracking naval targets. The missile is also programmed to strike at the waterline.
                
About 5,000 Mavericks have been fired in combat, with a success rate of 90%.

The Boeing manufactored AGM-69A is the predecessor of the AGM-131 SRAM II.
                
The B-52 Stratofortress carries 8 SRAMs on a rotary launcher in the bomb bay and up to 12 more on external pylons.
The FB-111A carries up to 6 SRAMs.
                
With the AGM-69A it is possible to attack known, fixed air-defense installations en route to the primary target. The number of targets that can be attacked per single bomber greatly increased with the use of the AGM-69A.

The AGM-78 Standard ARM (STARM) was developed due to certain deficiencies in the Shrike design. The missile is a modified Standard ship-to-air missile fitted with a gimbaled seeker and a smoke flare.
                
The use of a gimbaled seeker meant that the pilot did not have to boresight the missile/aircraft on the target before launch which enabled him to pass the target at a much safer distance. The smoke flare provided a mark for other aircraft allowing them to take out the air-defense site with HE and cluster munitions once the radar was blinded.
                
Further improvements resulted in the AGM-78C and D models which could operate closer in conjunction with the targeting avionics in the launch aircraft.
                
An inert training version of the AGM-78A was built as ATM-78A. Of equal size, mass and shape, the missile lacked a seeker head, warhead, or propulsion systems and was essentially just a dead weight.
                
An A2 model introduced a bomb damage assessment (BDA) capability and an SDU-6/B phosphorus target marker flare to facilitate targeting of the site for follow up attacks.
                
In 1969 an improved model called the AGM-78B was produced. This featured a broadband seeker which allowed the missile to be used against a much wider variety of targets without having to select the seeker before the mission. A simple memory circuit was also included, allowing the missile to attack a target once it locked on, even if the radar was shut down. Previous ARMs would veer off course and miss when they lost a target, and as a result flipping the radar on and off had become a standard tactic for missile batteries.
                
Some early AGM-78A1s were updated with the new memory circuit and seeker. These missiles were designated as the AGM-78A4. The AGM-78B was the most important version of the missile, and was widely used by the Air Force&apos;s F-4G Phantom II Wild Weasel aircraft.
                
A training version of the AGM-78B was created, and was known as the ATM-78B.
                
In the early 1970s the AGM-78C was produced. A US Air Force project, the C model was primarily intended to be more reliable and cheaper to build. It had a SDU-29/B white phosphorus target marker. Some older missiles were upgraded to the AGM-78C standard. As before, an ATM-78C training missile was produced.
                
Between 1973 and 1976 the AGM-78D was produced, introducing a new motor. A follow up missile, the AGM-78D2, had an active optical fuze, still greater reliability, and a new 100 kg (220 lb) blast-fragmentation warhead. The ATM-78D training missile followed.
                
The RGM-66D shipborne anti-radiation missile used the basic AGM-78 airframe along with features of the RIM-66 and AIM-97 Seekbat air-to-air missile.
                
Including all versions, over 3,000 AGM-78 missiles were built. Production stopped in the late 1970s, but the missile continued in service for almost a decade before the last examples were replaced by the AGM-88 HARM in the late 1980s.

The Harpoon is the only dedicated anti-ship missile in service with U.S. armed forces. It has been developed into several advanced versions, including the SLAM (Stand-off Land Attack Missile) derivatives for high-precision attacks on land targets. The Harpoon and SLAM will remain in service with the U.S. Navy for the foreseeable future.
                
In 1965 the U.S. Navy began studies for a missile in the 45 km (25 nm) range class for use against surfaced submarines. The name Harpoon was assigned to the project (i.e. a harpoon to kill &quot;whales&quot;, a naval slang term for submarines). After the sinking of the Isreali destroyer Eilat in 1967 by Soviet-built antiship missiles, the U.S. Navy saw the need to develop a dedicated anti-shipping missile, and therefore Harpoon&apos;s primary mission became surface ship attack. The development project was formally begun in 1968, and the missile designator ZAGM-84A was allocated in 1970 after the Navy had issued a formal RFP (Request For Proposals). In June 1971, McDonnell-Douglas was awarded the prime contract for Harpoon, and the first test missile flew in October 1972. By that time it had already been decided to develop airlaunched, ship-launched and submarine-launched Harpoon variants, designated AGM-84A, RGM-84A and UGM-84A, respectively. Because the range requirement was increased to 90 km (50 nm), turbojet propulsion was selected by McDonnell-Douglas. Production of the Harpoon began in 1975, and the first version to enter service was the shipborne RGM-84A in 1977, followed by the AGM-84A on P-3 aircraft in 1979. The UGM-84A became operational on attack submarines in 1981. There are also unarmed training versions of the AGM/RGM/UGM-84A, designated ATM-84A, RTM-84A and UTM-84A.

The AGM-84E Standoff Land Attack Missile (SLAM) was a subsonic, over-the-horizon air-launched cruise missile that was developed by Boeing Integrated Defense Systems from the McDonnell Douglas Harpoon antiship missile. The SLAM was designed to provide all-weather, day and night, precision attack capabilities against stationary high-value targets.
                
Except for new technologies in the guidance and seeker sections, which included a Global Positioning System receiver, a Walleye optical guidance system, and a newly developed Maverick missile datalink, all of the missile hardware came directly from the Harpoon missile. The SLAM is also equipped with a Tomahawk missile warhead for better destructive force. SLAM missile uses an inertial navigation system, which is supplemented by Global Positioning System (GPS) input, and it also uses Infrared homing terminal guidance.
                
Developed in only 48 months to meet the emergency requirements of the Persian Gulf War, a number of SLAMs were successfully employed during that war, when it struck Iraqi coastal targets. Also, the SLAM was used successfully in F/A-18 Hornet and A-6 Intruder air strikes during Operation Desert Storm even before official operational testing of the new missile had begun.[2] The SLAM was also used during United Nations air raids in Bosnia before &quot;Operation Joint Endeavor&quot;.
                
In the year 2000, the SLAM was replaced in service by the AGM-84H SLAM-ER (Standoff Land Attack Missile Expanded Response), which had numerous new capabilities including increased target penetration and nearly twice the range of the older AGM-84E SLAM

The AGM-84H/K SLAM-ER (Standoff Land Attack Missile-Expanded Response) is a precision-guided, air-launched cruise missile produced by Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security for the United States Armed Forces and their allies. Developed from the AGM-84E SLAM (Standoff Land Attack Missile) (itself developed by Boeing Integrated Defense Systems from the McDonnell Douglas Harpoon antiship missile), the SLAM-ER is capable of attacking land and sea targets at short-to-medium-ranges (155 nautical miles/270 km maximum). The SLAM-ER relies on the Global Positioning System (GPS) and infrared imaging for its navigation and control, and it can strike both moving and stationary targets.
                
The SLAM-ER, can be remotely controlled while in flight, and it can be redirected to another target after launch if the original target has already been destroyed, or is no longer considered to be dangerous (command guidance). The SLAM-ER is a very accurate weapon; as of 2009 it had the best circular error probable (CEP) of any missile used by the U.S. Navy..

In the late 1980s arms limitation treaties eliminated ALCMs as nuclear weapons but did allow for their conversion into conventionally armed missiles.
The new-production missiles were designated Block 1. The GPS system got improved cutting the CEP (circular error probability) in half an dthe warhead was switched to a larger 3,000lbs one.
                
To further improve accuracy the Block 1A evolved equipped with a precision accuracy kit that uses a third generation GPS reciever, a GPS anti-jam module and a new antenna to lessen the jamming vulnerability. It also incorporates enhanced shallow or steep terminal dive capability.
                
AGM-86B
The nuclear armed AGM-86B uses a terrain contour-matching guidance system (TERCOM) to fly to its assigned target.
                        
AGM-86C/D
The AGM-86C/D CALCM carries a conventional fragmentation payload rather than a thermonuclear payload. The AGM-86C/D uses an onboard Global Positioning System (GPS) coupled with its inertial navigation system (INS) to navigate in flight. This allows the missile to guide itself to the target with pinpoint accuracy. Litton Guidance and Control, and Interstate Electronics Corp. were the guidance contractors for the C-model.

The AGM-88 HARM (High Speed Anti-Radiation Missile) is designed to destroy enemy air defense radar systems. The missile uses a directional radar antenna and sophisticated signal processing to locate, identify and prioritize enemy radar threats. The missile can work without input from its parent aircraft, but gain additional flexibility with the addition of specialized avionics. Units such as the HTS pods for the F-16C and the APR-47 carried by the F-4G allow highly selective targeting even in the densest threat environments. The EA-6B is the most capable HARM platform in the U.S. Navy arsenal, but all Navy strike aircraft are equipped to shoot HARMs.
                
The HARM missile was developed based on the combat experiences of Wild Weasel crews during the Vietnam War. Its main advancements over previous ARMs were a broadband detector, computerized signal processing with a programmable threat library, and a Mach 2 speed. The retirement of the F-4G leaves the F-16C tasked with Wild Weasel missions. Since the F-16 lacks the specialized avionics of the F-4G as well as the expertise of a specialized &quot;guy-in-back&quot;, much of the onus for successfully suppressing enemy air defenses will fall on the CPU and sensors of the HARM weapon system.
                
About 2,000 HARM missiles have been fired in combat. Success rates are classified, but are probably high.
                
Engagement Sequence
The engagement sequence of the HARM varies considerably depending upon the avionics of the launching aircraft. In an F-16 equipped with HTS pods, the pilot selects a target on the HTS MFD. The MFD displays active SEAD targets detected by the HARM missile, known SEAD targets programmed into the system before the mission (based on recent ELINT intelligence), and SEAD targets datalinked by other aircraft. The HARM can be fired at a non-emitting target, but has a better probability of a kill if the target is active. (It may also be more cost effective to use cheap, unguided munitions on a non-emitting site). Once a target is selected, the F-16 pilot flies to within the HARM&apos;s launch parameters and fires.
                
Tactics
The SEAD missions can be classified as either &quot;force protection&quot; or &quot;search and destroy&quot;. Force protection missions (usually escorts into threat territory) require judicious target selection and good timing. HARMs can be fired preemptively at a non-emitting site to protect a package flying within range of an important radar threat. If the site goes active to engage the package, the HARM will take out the radar. If the radar doesn&apos;t come up, the HARM still has a chance of a kill. The weapon launch should be timed so that the missile will reach the radar just as the package reaches the effective engagement range of the radar (as a rule of thumb, allow one second for every nautical mile the missile must travel). This tactic is generally used early in a war, when enemy air defenses are still relatively intact. After the radar is destroyed, it is generally inadvisable to continue the attack in order to finish off the site during a SEAD escort since a new threat could attack your package while you are so engaged.
                
For search and destroy missions, the hunter-killer tactics developed in the Vietnam War can be used, although the hunter team doesn&apos;t need to take as many risks to keep the threat site emitting since the HARM remembers the radar&apos;s location and travels much faster than the old Shrike missile. After the missile guidance radar is killed, the SAM launchers, reloading vehicles and control vans should be destroyed with free-fall munitions. The CBU-87 cluster bomb is a good weapon of choice for this job since it can destroy both hard and soft targets.

The Hellfire is the primary anti-tank weapon of the U.S. AH-64, AH-1, Blackhawk, Kiowa and Defender helicopters. Although normally fielded as a laser-guided weapon, the Hellfire is capable of using an Imaging Infrared seeker, a Radio Frequency/IR seeker and a millimeter wave seeker. The missile has both a Lock-On Before Launch (LOBL) mode and a Lock-On After Launch (LOAL) mode.
                
In the opening hours of Operation Desert Storm, eight Apaches armed with Hellfires were tasked to attack early-warning radar sites in western Iraq. The mission was a success, and within two minutes of engaging the targets, had scored 15 hits with Hellfire missiles. During the entire war, Apaches fired an estimated 5,000 Hellfires, and destroyed an estimated 500 tanks with them.

The Penguin is a Norwegian ship-, coast- and (in later versions) air-launched anti-ship weapon, which was developed in the 1960s as NATO&apos;s first modern dedicated anti-ship guided missile. An air-launched variant is also used by the U.S. Navy under the designation AGM-119.
                
Development of the original Penguin Mk 1 began in the mid-1960s by the Kongsberg Vpenfabrikk (later renamed Norsk Forsvarsteknologi, and still later Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace (as a division of Kongsberg Gruppen)) in Norway, helped by financial support from the U.S. Navy. It was designed for use from small missile boats and coastal batteries and entered service with the Royal Norwegian Navy in 1972. Because the Scandinavian coastal waters with its deep narrow fjords would have presented the radars of the time with too much clutter, the Penguin used infrared homing only. Initial bearing and speed data on the target was provided before launch by the launch platform&apos;s sensors and fire-control system. The additional advantage of the passive IR homing was the reduced warning time for the attacked ship.
The missile used the 113 kg (250 lb) MK 19 warhead very similar to that used by the AGM-12 Bullpup missile. The Penguin Mk 1 is no longer in service.

In 1984, the Naval Weapons Center (NWC) in China Lake created the AGM-123A Skipper II laser-guided standoff missile using off-the-shelf components. The GBU-16/B Paveway II LGB (Laser-Guided Bomb), consisting of a 450 kg (1000 lb) MK 83 bomb, an MXU-667/B airfoil group, and an MAU-169/B guidance
section, was combined with a MK 78 rocket motor (taken from obsolete AGM-45B Shrike missiles) in a WPU-5/B propulsion section. The first test launches were conducted in June 1984, and in March 1985 a contract for full-scale production of 2500 AGM-123As was awarded to Emerson Electric. The Skipper II (there was no &quot;Skipper I&quot;, the &quot;II&quot; was derived from the Paveway II guidance) achieved Initial Operational Capability with the U.S. Navy in late 1985. The ATM-123A was an inert training variant of the AGM-123A.
                
The AGM-123A was primarily employed by the A-6E Intruder in the anti-shipping role. It was a simple and effective weapon, which could lock on a laser-designated target before or after launch. The powered glide-bomb could theoretically reach a range of 55 km (30 nm), but in practice this was usually limited to about 25 km (13.5 nm) by the range of the laser designator (which was normally carried by the launching aircraft).

The AGM-129 ACM cruise missile is a significant improvement over the ALCM-B. It is superior in range, accuracy and survivability. It has a reduced IR profile and low radar cross section and can therefore be called a &quot;stealthy&quot; missile.
                
The designation AGM-123B was allocated to a variant described as &quot;forward fit version of the AGM-123A&quot;. The AGM-123B is described by source [4] as having a WCU-10A/B control section and MXU-737A/B airfoil group, and the manufacturer is quoted as Texas Instruments. I have no information how many (if any) Skipper IIs were actually built as AGM-123B. The Skipper II is no longer in service with the U.S. Navy, having been phased out in the mid-1990s.

The AGM-130A is a powered version of the GBU-15 glide bomb. A rocket booster has been attached to the weapon to extend its range; it jettisons after the motor is spent. Otherwise, the AGM-130 operates the same as the GBU-15. The extra range drastically improves the aircraft&apos;s survivability in high threat environments since the launching platform doesn&apos;t even need to unmask to put the weapon on target with pinpoint accuracy.
                
The AGM-130 saw its first operational service on 11 January 1999 during Operation Northern Watch, when a pair of AGM-130s were used by F-15Es to destroy two Iraqi SAM sites.
The AGM-130 was also the weapon used in the April 1999 NATO strike on a railway bridge in Grdelica, Serbia.

The SRAM II short-range attack missile was planned as a replacement for the AGM-69B SRAM B but was never produced in quantity.
With resurrection of the B-1 Program (B-1B) in 1981, development of a complete new weapon, the SRAM II, started. This missile had only 2/3 the size of the AGM-69A, so that the B-1B could carry 36 missiles instead of 24 AGM-69As. The new missile was lighter and simpler, with a more reliable rocket motor with increased range. Its new W-89 thermonuclear warhead was also much safer to operate then the previous W-69.
                
The program was cancelled in 1991 because of technical difficulties with the rocket motor and because of the nuclear arms reduction policy.

AGM-142 was the first missile to provide precision guided munition capability to the B-52H platform. It does so by having an INS with datalink and TV or imaging infrared systems. It may be controlled by the launching aircraft or handed over to a second allowing the launching aircraft to leave the area. It is propelled by a constant thrust solid-fuel rocket.
                
The weapon was in service at the time of the Gulf War but was never fired during the crisis due to the Israeli origins that would have offended USA&apos;s Arab allies. There are rumors that are denied by the authorities about a few operational test firings.

The AGM-154 JSOW (Joint Standoff Weapon) is a modular precision-attack glide bomb, which is included in this missile directory because of its guided missile designation (future versions of JSOW will possibly be powered, though).
                
In 1986, the U.S. Navy started the AIWS (Advanced Interdiction Weapon System) program to develop a new precision guided short-range standoff attack weapon to replace laser guided weapons like the Paveway series guided bombs, the AGM-123 Skipper II and the AGM-65E Maverick. The primary development goal was a pure fire-and-forget weapon without any post-launch target designation, like a laser designator or a command data link. The AIWS competition was won by Texas Instruments (now Raytheon), who received a contract for the AGM-154A weapon in June 1992. In the same year, the AIWS program was combined with Air Force standoff weapons programs and renamed JSOW (Joint Standoff Weapon). The JSOW requirements called for a low-cost, light-weight weapon with at least 9 km (5 nm) range for low-altitude launches. A lock-on after launch (LOAL) capability was also desired, so that the launching aircraft would not have to put itself into line-of-sight from the target. Another requirement was &quot;quiet launch&quot; capability, i.e. the propulsion system (in any) was to be activated only some time after the release. Because the JSOW was to be used against different kinds of targets, a modular warhead section for cluster and unitary warheads was also required. As a solution to these requirements, Texas Instruments designed a GPS/INS guided unpowered glide bomb. The first guided drop of an AGM-154A occurred In December 1994, and in February 1997 operational evaluation by the U.S. Navy began. Initial Operational Capability (IOC) was reached in 1999, when full-scale production of the AGM-154A began. The AGM-154A JSOW uses flip-out wings and four cruciform (plus two small horizontal) tailfins for flight control. The glide range is 28 km (15 nm) for low-altitude and up to 74 km (40 nm) for high-altitude launches. Accuracy of the GPS/INS guidance system is better than 3 m (10 ft) CEP. As a warhead, the AGM-154A variant uses a cluster bomb dispenser with 145 BLU-97/B CEM (Combined Effects Munition) bomblets (1.54 kg (3.4 lb) each) for use against soft targets. The DATM-154A is a completely inert shape for JSOW ground handling training.

The AGM-154C (developed for the Navy only) uses a &quot;BROACH&quot; multi-stage blast fragmentation/penetrator warhead, developed by BAE Systems. It also features an IIR seeker and ATA (Automatic Target Acquisition) technology (similar to that of the AGM-84H/K SLAM-ER ATA). The ATA feature allows the missile to find the target without intervention of an operator, because the internal logic compares the IIR seeker&apos;s image with preset reference images. ATA made it possible to drop the twoway data link which was originally planned for the AGM-154C. Operational testing for the AGM-154C is currently scheduled for early 2003, with Initial Operational Capability planned for late 2003. The first LRIP (Low-Rate Initial Production) contract for the AGM-154C was awarded to Raytheon in July 2003.
                
JSOW can currently be used by the F-16, F/A-18 and B-2 aircraft, with the B-52, B-1, and F-15E planned to follow. More than 100 AGM-154As were already used in combat, including Operation Allied Force in Kosovo and Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. The original total requirement for the USAF and U.S. Navy was for more than 20000 JSOW missiles of all variants, but this will most likely be reduced after cancellation of the AGM-154B.

The AGM-158 JASSM is a stealthy cruise missile for stand-off attacks. It is guided by a jamming resistant GPS-aided inertial navigation system with an accuracy quoted as 2.4 m CEP. It uses an imaging infrared seeker to identify and home in on its target. A data link is available for status and position reports for better bomb damage assessment.
                
The JASSM is planned to be integrated into all U.S. strike aircrafts in the future. Many kinds of upgrades are also considered, including a sub-munition dispenser warhead, new types of seekers and an extended range version of the missile. Service entry is expected for 2003.

The AH-1 gunship is an effective anti-armor/close air support aircraft, and for that reason, it is a favorite with the U.S. Marine Corps. Its TOW missiles are highly effective against tanks and various ground targets, while its cannon is quite capable of dealing with Light Armored Vehicles (LAVs) and infantry. Furthermore, Cobras are routinely retrofitted for improvements to their engines and targeting and sighting systems to ensure they maintain their usefulness in the future. This helicopter is deceptively difficult to engage in air-to-air combat. It has an extremely small silhouette, making it incredibly difficult to hit, and it has air-to-air missiles that it can use against any hostile aircraft.

The Apache was developed as a durable anti-armor platform. Typical Apache techniques include nap-of-the-earth flying and pop-up attacks on armor with its accurate and deadly Hellfire missiles. While Apaches have very limited air-to-air capability, they are vital in their ground support role. The effectiveness of the Apache was summarized by a tank commander, who said that he saw no reason to engage tanks himself when the A-10 Warthog and the AH-64 could do it faster and with fewer casualties. The Apache is strictly an American military asset.
                
The Apache has seen combat during Operations Just Cause and Desert Storm. The helicopter has performed well despite problems with mechanical reliability. Its chain gun in particular has been a constant source of problems, frequently jamming in combat.

The AH-64D improves on the AH-64A in several ways, including upgraded engines and electronics. However, the greatest difference between the two is the AH-64D&apos;s Longbow radar. This radar allows the AH-64 to fire the newer Hellfire RF &quot;fire and forget&quot; missiles, which greatly increase the craft&apos;s accuracy and lethality against enemy armor units.
                
The Longbow has never been used in combat.

Formerly known as AH-64D Block III in 2012, it was redesignated as AH-64E Guardian to represent its increased capabilities.
                
The AH-64E features improved digital connectivity, the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System, more powerful T700-GE-701D engines with upgraded face gear transmission to accommodate more power, capability to control unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), full IFR capability, and improved landing gear.
New composite rotor blades, which successfully completed testing in 2004, increase cruise speed, climb rate, and payload capacity. Deliveries began in November 2011. Full-rate production was approved on 24 October 2012 with 634 AH-64Ds to be upgraded to AH-64E standard and production of 56 new-build AH-64Es to start in 2019/20. Changes in production lots 4 through 6 shall include a cognitive decision aiding system and new self-diagnostic abilities. The   Longbow radar has an oversea capacity, potentially enabling naval strikes; an AESA radar is under consideration. The E model is to be fit for maritime operations. The Army has expressed a desire to add extended-range fuel tanks to the AH-64E to further increase range and endurance.
AH-64Es are to have the L-3 Communications MUM-TX datalink installed in place of two previous counterparts, communicating on C, D, L, and Ku frequency bands to transmit and receive data and video with all Army UAVs. Lots 5 and 6 will be equipped with Link 16 data-links.

In 1951, Raytheon began work on the semi-active radar homing version of Sparrow family of missiles, the AAM-N-6 Sparrow III. The first of these weapons entered US Navy service in 1958.
                
The AAM-N-6a was similar to the -6, but used a new Thiokol liquid-fuel rocket engine for improved performance. It also included changes to the guidance electronics to make it effective at higher closing speeds. The -6a was also selected to arm the Air Force&apos;s F-110A Spectre (F-4 Phantom) fighters in 1962, known to them as the AIM-101. It entered production in 1959, eventually being built to about 7500 examples.
                
In 1963 the Navy and Air Force agreed on a standardized naming for their missiles, the Sparrows becoming the AIM-7 series. The original Sparrow I and aborted Sparrow II became the AIM-7A and AIM-7B, even though both were long gone from the inventory. The -6, -6a and -6B became the AIM-7C, AIM-7D and AIM-7E respectively.

In 1963, production switched to the AIM-7E version. It used a new propulsion system, a solid-fueled rocket by Rocketdyne (either a MK 38 or later a MK 52). The new motor again significantly increased range and performance of the missile. Effective range of course depended greatly on firing parameters like launch speed and relative velocity of the target. In head-on attacks under optimal conditions, it could be as high as 35 km (20 nm), while in stern attacks, maximum effective range was more around 5.5 km(3 nm).
                
Inert training versions of the AIM-7E include the ATM-7E for firing practice, the captive (non-launching) CATM-7E, and the non-flying DATM-7E for handling and loading practice. There is also a captive-carry version designated CAEM-7E, which is equipped with special telemetry electronics. About 7500 AIM-7D and 25000 AIM-7E missiles were built, and the Sparrow was used heavily in Vietnam by the USAF and the U.S. Navy. The first combat kill was scored on 7 June 1965, when USN F-4B Phantoms shot down 2 MiG-17s. However, the initial combat results were very disappointing.
                
The potentially long range of the AIM-7 could not be used, because unreliable IFF capabilities of the time effectively required visual identification of all targets. Coupled with the high minimum range of the missile of 1500 m (5000 ft) and poor performance against maneuvering and/or low-flying targets, this led to a kill probability of less than 10%.
                
Therefore, the improved AIM-7E-2 was introduced in 1969 as a &quot;dogfight missile&quot;. It had a shorter minimum range, clipped wings for higher maneuverability, and improved autopilot and fusing. The AIM-7E-3 had further improved fusing and higher reliability, and the AIM-7E-4 was specially adapted for use with high-power fighter radars (like the F-14&apos;s AN/AWG-9). Despite all problems, more than 50 aircraft were shot down by Sparrow missiles during the Vietnam air war.

In the early 1960s, the U.S. Navy planned to provide a short-range missile defense system (called BPDMS - Basic Point Defense Missile System) for ships much smaller than then current missile defense ships. Initially the RIM-46 Sea Mauler missile was to be used for the BPDMS, but when this was cancelled in 1964, attention turned towards a derivative of the AIM-7E Sparrow. This missile was known as RIM-7E Sea Sparrow. The missile was essentially an unchanged AIM-7E, and was fired from modified
ASROC launchers designated MK 25. The RIM-7E entered service in 1967.

In January 1972, Raytheon began development of the vastly improved AIM-7F. It featured a new dual thrust (boost/sustain) rocket motor (usually a Hercules MK 58, but sometimes an Aerojet MK 65), which greatly increased the missile&apos;s range. The AIM-7F also had a completely new solid-state electronic guidance and control system (GCS), designated AN/DSQ-35, which was also compatible with modern pulse-doppler radars. Continued improvement of the GCS resulted in versions from AN/DSQ-35A through -35H (used in the AIM-7F-11). The smaller GCS permitted the use of a larger 39 kg (86 lb) MK 71 warhead in the new WAU-10/B warhead section. Production began in 1975, and continued through 1981. With the AIM-7F, the official name of the missile was changed from Sparrow III to plain Sparrow.

Originally developed in the 1950s as the harbinger of a new era in air-to-air combat in which fighter aircraft would use radar and missiles to destroy targets without ever getting close enough to see them, the AIM-7 Sparrow&apos;s performance in real combat was disappointing at best. The failure of Beyond Visual Range (BVR) combat in the Vietnam War sent both U.S. Air Force and Navy fliers back to the drawing boards in search of better tactics and better training. Even as late as 1989, the missile&apos;s performance has been underwhelming; out of eight missiles fired in various engagements during the 1980s, only two hit their targets. Modern versions of the missile share little more than the name and air frame with its Vietnam-era brethren, and performed somewhat better during Operation Desert Storm. Out of 88 Sparrow missiles fired in the Gulf War, 23 destroyed their targets, representing 70% of Coalition aerial victories. The reasons for the improved performance are thought to be better U.S. pilot training, new solid-state electronics and the abysmal performance of Iraqi pilots (the Sparrow has always done well against non-maneuvering targets).
                
Engagement Sequence
The Sparrow operates by semi-active radar homing. The missile can home on both pulse-Doppler and continuous wave radar signals, enabling it to be fired by most radar equipped U.S. warplanes. Reliability aside, the main tactical weakness of the Sparrow is that the launching fighter must maintain a lock until the missile hits its target. This requirement allows the missile to be defeated by a turn into the beam and can force the attacker into an undesirable situation since his maneuvers are constrained while he maintains a lock.

The AIM-9 Sidewinder is the world&apos;s most successful short-range air-to-air missile, and will remain the U.S. military&apos;s main &quot;dogfight&quot; AAM for the foreseeable future.
                
Development of Sidewinder began in 1950 at the NOTS (Naval Ordnance Test Station) later renamed as NWC (Naval Weapons Center) at China Lake. The idea was to create a very simple heat-seeking air to air missile by equipping a 12.7 cm (5 in) air-to-air rocket with a lead sulphide (PbS) photo cell in a hemispherical glass nose to detect IR radiation. Another simple, yet effective, idea was the use of &quot;Rollerons&quot; (slipstream-driven wheels at the fin trailing edges acting as stabilizing gyros) as roll-stabilizing devices. The first test missiles were fired in 1951, and on 11 September 1953, the first air-to-air hit on a drone was scored. In the same year, the prototype missile received the official designation XAAM-N-7.
                
General Electric began low-rate production in 1955, and in May 1956, the AAM-N-7 Sidewinder I entered U.S. Navy service. Only 240 Sidewinder I missiles were built, and full-rate production missiles (built by Ford Aerospace (Philco) and General Electric) were known as AAM-N-7 Sidewinder IA. I have found no evidence that the AAM-N-7 designations ever used suffix letters (like AAM-N-7a, etc.). For ease of reference, I will use the post-1963 designations of AIM-9A (Sidewinder I) and AIM-9B (Sidewinder IA) throughout this text, even when referring to pre-1963 events.
                
The AIM-9A/B used a 4.5 kg (10 lb) blast-fragmentation warhead. This was triggered by an IR proximity or contact fuse, and had an effective kill radius of about 9 m (30 ft). The uncooled PbS seeker of these early missiles had a 4° angle of view and a tracking rate of 11°/s, and the missile itself could turn at 12G. Propulsion was provided by a Thiokol MK 17 solid-fuel rocket motor (17.8 kN (4000 lb) thrust for 2.2 s), which could propel the missile to a speed of Mach 1.7 above launch speed. Because of the limitations of
the seeker, the AIM-9A/B could only be used for tail-on engagements of non-maneuvering(!) targets at ranges between 900 m (3000 ft) and 4.8 km (2.6 nm). The missile was also very susceptible to other heat sources (sun, ground reflections).
                
Because of the usual inter-service rivalry, the USAF did not adopt the Sidewinder, until a &quot;fly-off&quot; against the USAF&apos;s GAR-2/AIM-4B Falcon in June 1955 showed the superiority of the Sidewinder. The USAF subsequently procured the AIM-9B under the designation GAR-8. More than 80000 AIM-9B missiles were produced until 1962.
                
On 24 September 1958, the Sidewinder achieved the world&apos;s first successful use of air-to-air guided missiles, when Taiwanese F-86Fs shot down Communist Chinese MiG-15s using AIM-9Bs supplied by the U.S. Navy.
                
The limited performance of the AIM-9B prompted the Navy to look for improvements. The AAM-N-7 Sidewinder IC was developed in two version: a semi-active radar homing version (called Sidewinder IB in source [1]), designated AIM-9C in 1963, and an IR guided version, later designated as AIM-9D. Improvements common to both IC versions include a new Hercules MK 36 solid-fuel rocket motor for significantly increased speed and 18 km (9.7 nm) range, a larger MK 48 continuous-rod warhead, and slightly larger fins.
                
The SARH AIM-9C was only used with the Navy&apos;s F8U Crusader fighters to provide these with an all weather capability without having to fit a Sparrow-compatible radar. However, the AIM-9C was not very successful, and only 1000 were built by Motorola between 1965 and 1967. Many were later converted into AGM-122A Sidearm anti-radiation missiles.

The IR seeker of the AIM-9D (in a more pointed nose) featured a new nitrogen-cooled PbS seeker, which had field of view of only 2.5° (reduced background noise) and a higher tracking rate of 12°/s. However, only about 1000 AIM-9D missiles were built (by Philco-Ford and Raytheon) between 1965 and 1969.
                
A training version of the AIM-9D for captive flight target acquisition, which had the warhead replaced by a WDU-9/B dummy warhead, was later designated as ATM-9D. The WDU-9/B is also used in all
subsequent inert ATM/CATM/NATM-9 versions. Early training Sidewinders for firing practice were designated GDU-1/B.

The AIM-9E was the first version specifically developed by the USAF. It was an improved AIM-9B with a new seeker with thermoelectric (Peltier) cooling, and a higher tracking rate of 16.5°/s. The Peltier cooling method allowed unlimited cooling time while the missile was on the launch rail. Externally, the AIM-9E differed from the AIM-9B by its longer conical nose section. About 5,000 AIM-9Bs were converted to AIM-9E. The AIM-9E-2 is a variant with a reduced-smoke motor.

Another Navy variant was the AIM-9G, an improved AIM-9D. It featured SEAM (Sidewinder Expanded Acquisition Mode), which allowed the optics either to be slewed through a search pattern, or to be slaved to the aircraft&apos;s radar to acquire a target. 2,120 AIM-9G were built by Raytheon from 1970 to 1972. Equivalent to ATM-9D, there was also an ATM-9G training version of the AIM-9G.
                
The Sidewinder was of course used extensively over Vietnam by both the USAF and the Navy. The Air Force scored 28 AIM-9 air-to-air kills using the AIM-9B/E versions, achieving a kill probability for this missile of about 16%. The USN&apos;s most successful Sidewinder variants in Vietnam were the AIM-9D and -
9G, which were responsible for the majority of USN air-to-air kills in this conflict. A total of 82 air-to-air kills over Vietnam are attributed to the AIM-9.

To increase the reliability of the AIM-9G, the Navy developed the AIM-9H. The main difference to the AIM-9G were solid-state electronics in the guidance and control system. The seeker tracking rate was increased to complement the more powerful actuators. It was also improved to resist the shock of carrier landings and catapult launches. Only a few AIM-9Hs were fired over Vietnam, but they were credited with a higher kill rate than any other AIM-9 version in Vietnam. About 7,700 AIM-9Hs were produced by Philco-Ford and Raytheon between 1972 and 1974. The ATM-9H was a training version for captive flight target acquisition.

The USAF&apos;s AIM-9J was an improved AIM-9E. It had partial solid-state electronics, a longer-burning gas generator (increasing flight time), and more powerful actuators which drove new square-tipped double delta canards. The latter feature doubled the single-plane &quot;G&quot;-capability of the missile. About 10,000 AIM-9Js were eventually built from 1972 on, mostly by converting existing AIM-9B/E missiles.

The AIM-9M is a development of the AIM-9L and replaced the latter on the production line. It features a reduced-smoke rocket motor, an improved guidance section designated WGU-4/B, better
countermeasures resistance (IRCCM - infrared Counter-Countermeasures), and improved overall reliability. Production began in 1982, and so far more than 7,000 missiles have been built by Raytheon in subtypes numbered AIM-9M-1 through AIM-9M-10. The principal current production versions are the AIM-9M-8 (USN) and AIM-9M-9 (USAF). They have further improved IRCM detection circuitry, and the latest versions of the rocket motor (MK 36 MOD 11), guidance section (WGU-4E/B), and AOTD (DSU- 15B/B). The AIM-9M-10 is a slightly modified -9M-8 for use by the F/A-18E/F Hornet. Most existing AIM-9Ms will be upgraded to -9M-8/9 standard. In Operation Desert Storm in 1991, 13 air-to-air kills were attributed to the Sidewinder, all of which were probably AIM-9M missiles.

The AIM-9P is an improved version of the J model. It has greater engagement boundaries, enabling it to be launched farther from the target. The more maneuverable P model also incorporated improved solid-state electronics that increased reliability and maintainability. Deliveries began in 1978.
                
The AIM-9P-1 has an active optical target detector instead of the infrared influence fuse; the AIM-9P-2 added a reduced-smoke motor. The most recently developed version, the AIM-9P-3, combined both the active optical target detector and the reduced-smoke motor. It also has added mechanical strengthening to the warhead as well as the guidance and control section. The improved warhead uses new explosive material that is less sensitive to high temperature and has a longer shelf life.

For many years Eastern Block forces had superior WVR- IR missiles. The AA-11 Archer with it&apos;s off boresight capabilities was a serious threat to western fighters.
                
The British developed a new missile to counter this, the ASRAAM. The Israeli&apos;s developed the Python 4. The United States contracted the makers of the Sidewinder, then Hughes to expand the capabilities of the Aim-9M.
                
The result was the Aim-9X, with shot capabilities up to 90 degrees off-boresight and a seeker range that exceeds all previous AIM-9 missiles. Increased IRCCM, lower drag airframe and thrust vectoring controls make the missile tremendously lethal even on maneuvering targets. Its small motor is it&apos;s only drawback, since a fast burnout allows only one chance to hit its intended target.

The AIM-54 Phoenix is the only long-range air-to-air missile currently in service with the U.S. armed forces, and is exclusively used by the U.S. Navy&apos;s F-14 Tomcat fighters.
                
Development of the Phoenix began in late 1960, after the U.S. Navy&apos;s projected F6D Missileer and the associated AAM-N-10 Eagle long-range interception missile had been cancelled. Hughes then started to develop a new long-range missile, designated AAM-N-11 by the Navy, together with the AN/AWG-9 FCS (Fire Control System). The new missile and FCS used technology previously tested by the AIM-47 Falcon and AN/ASG-18, respectively, in the USAF&apos;s YF-12A program. The Phoenix/AWG-9 combination was originally intended as the main armament for the F-111B, then planned to become the Navy&apos;s new air superiority fighter and long-range interceptor. In June 1963, the AAM-N-11 was redesignated as AIM-54A. Flight tests of XAIM-54A prototypes began in 1965, and the first guided interception succeeded in September 1966. While the Phoenix test program continued, the F-111B was cancelled, and the AIM-54 and AN/AWG-9 were incorporated into the new F-14 Tomcat, which was to take over the role of the F-111B. The first production AIM-54A missiles were delivered in 1973, ready for deployment with the first F-14A squadron in 1974.
                
An F-14 can carry up to 6 Phoenix missiles, on LAU-93/A (F-14A/B) or LAU-132/A (F-14D) launchers, respectively. The AN/AWG-9 FCS uses a TWS (Track While Scan) pulse-doppler radar, and can track up to 24 targets simultaneously at ranges of up to 240 km (130 nm). Therefore, an F-14 can effectively attack 6 targets simultaneously. When an AIM-54A is launched, its Rocketdyne MK 47 or Aerojet MK 60 solid-fueled rocket motor (in an MXU-637/B propulsion section) propels it to a speed of Mach 4+. For midcourse guidance, the missile&apos;s AN/DSQ-26 guidance section employs an autopilot, which gets regular target position updates by semi-active radar tracking. The FCS radar periodically illuminates every target to which a missile has been dispatched. For maximum range, the missile flies an optimized high-altitude trajectory for reduced drag. For the final 18,200 m (20,000 yds) of the interception, the Phoenix switches to active radar homing for high terminal accuracy. Minimum engagement range is about 3.7 km (2 nm), in which case active homing is used from the beginning. The 60 kg (132 lb) MK 82 blast-fragmentation warhead is detonated by a fusing system consisting of a MK 334 radar proximity, an IR proximity, and an impact fuse.
                
There are several non-tactical variants of the AIM-54A. The ATM-54A is a version with inert warhead for firing exercises, the CATM-54A is the captive (non-launching) version for target acquisition practice, and the DATM-54A is a completely inert dummy missile for ground handling training. The AEM-54A is a variant with special telemetry electronics for test and evaluation purposes.

In 1977, development of the significantly improved AIM-54C began. The AIM-54C features completely new digital WGU-11/B guidance and WCU-7/B control sections. The missile incorporates a programmable digital signal processor, and the autopilot now uses a strap-down inertial navigation system. One very important feature of the AIM-54C is its vastly improved ECCM capability. Improvements in the rocket motor increase speed and range, and the new DSU-28/B target detection device improves fusing accuracy in high-clutter environments and for small and low-altitude targets. The first XAIM-54C prototypes were delivered in August 1979, and after tests with YAIM-54C missiles, production of the Phoenix switched to the AIM-54C in 1982. Initial Operational Capability of the AIM-54C was reached in 1986. Non-tactical variants include the ATM-54C for firing exercises, the CATM-54C
captive (non-launching) version for target acquisition practice, and the AEM-54C with special telemetry electronics for test and evaluation purposes. There is no DATM-54C, because the DATM-54A is also suitable for AIM-54C ground handling training.
                
The Phoenix has been manufactured in a number of different models.
Phoenix missile versions: AIM-54A, the first Phoenix missile version; AIM-54B, the second Phoenix missile version, which incorporated several upgrades including sheet-metal wings and fins; AIM-54C Improved Phoenix, developed for anticipated threats, optimized for use against multiple close-interval cruise missiles and waves or streams of hostile aircraft; AIM-54C+, also known as Dry Phoenix, eliminated the need for taping into the aircraft&apos;s coolant system; AIM-54D, another Phoenix version incorporating additional modifications.
                
The AIM-54C was continually upgraded during production. Early in the production run, the MK 82 warhead was replaced by a new WDU-29/B warhead in a WAU-16/B or WAU-20/B warhead section. The WDU-29/B offers a 20 to 25 percent increase in effectiveness. Another improvement was the addition of internal temperature compensation, which eliminated the need for the F-14 to provide temperature compensation liquid during captive flight. Missiles with this feature, first delivered in 1986, are called &quot;sealed&quot;, and are sometimes referred to as AIM-54C+. During the production, the ECCM capabilities were still further improved, and &quot;sealed&quot; AIM-54C missiles with improved ECCM are known in the U.S. Navy as AIM-54C ECCM/Sealed. This variant reached IOC in 1988. The guidance and control sections of the ECCM/Sealed missile are the WGU-17/B and WCU-12/B, respectively, and the available warhead sections are the WAU-19/B and WAU-21/B. Other improvements, which can be retrofitted to older AIM-54C rounds, include a reprogrammable memory, and new software for the signal processor.
                
When production ceased in the early 1990s, more than 5000 AIM-54 missiles of all versions had been built, about half of these being AIM-54Cs. Because the Phoenix is used only by the F-14 Tomcat, it will remain in service as long as this aircraft, and the F-14 will be phased out by 2007 approximately. All operational Phoenix missiles are now of the AIM-54C variant, and the remaining AIM-54As have been placed in storage. The AIM-54 was primarily designed for long-range fleet defense against incoming bomber streams, a threat which has diminished nowadays. Although it can theoretically also be used against low-flying high-speed anti-ship missiles, there are more effective weapons for this role. Currently, there are no plans to field any other missile with Phoenix-like performance characteristics when the AIM-54 is retired. The fleet defense role after the retirement of the F-14/AIM-54 combination will be taken by the F/A-18E/F Hornet armed with AIM-120C AMRAAM missiles.

The AIM-92 Stinger or ATAS (Air To Air Stinger) is an air-to-air missile developed from the shoulder-launched FIM-92 Stinger system, for use on helicopters such as the AH-64 Apache, Eurocopter Tiger and also UAVs such as the MQ-1 Predator. The missile itself is identical to the shoulder-launched Stinger. 
                
The US Army has used the ATAS variant on its OH-58D Kiowa Warrior and UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters in the air-to-air role.
                
In a 19 November 1996 demonstration, a Stinger (ATAS) Block-1 missile was launched from an OH-58D piloted by CPT Bob Blanchett at Yuma Proving Ground and successfully destroyed a QUH-1 drone helicopter deploying countermeasures at a range greater than 4,500 meters.
                
All Air-to-Air Stinger (ATAS) Block II missiles will be modified existing Stinger RMP missiles (FIM-92C). Block II will incorporate various improvements including a new staring IR focal plane array seeker, a new battery, and advanced signal processing capabilities. The seeker permits engagements of helicopters in clutter out to the 8 km maximum physical range of the missile, also improved accuracy and IRCCM capabilities, and will provide a full night capability. The Block II missile also supports seeker slaving (steering the missile's seeker off-axis before launch to lock onto targets). This was first demonstrated on 6 November 1997 at Yuma.
                
ATAL is an upgrade to the Air-to-Air Stinger launcher fielded on the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior and Blackhawk helicopters. In mid 2000, tests were carried out with the ATAL system mounted on the AH-64 Apache Longbow helicopter. Nine missiles were fired, eight of which scored direct hits against simulated hovering helicopter targets in a clutter environment. The missiles were launched with the Longbow helicopter traveling at speeds from hovering to 136 knots, side slips up to 30 knots, partial power descents, pull-up maneuvers, hovering pedal turns, push-over maneuvers, and a 22-degree bank.

The AIM-120 AMRAAM was developed in the 1980s to replace the AIM-7 Sparrow. One of the chief disadvantages of the Sparrow missile was that the launching fighter had to maintain a radar lock on the target for the entire flight of the missile. Besides giving the target plenty of opportunity to defeat the missile by breaking the radar lock, it also left the shooter vulnerable to counterattack since his maneuvers were constrained while he maintained a lock on a single bandit. In addition, a SARH missile needs a fairly strong radar return to guide on, which is guaranteed to give away an attack on any Radar Warning Receiver- (RWR) equipped target. Part of the solution to this problem was to put an entire radar set into the missile itself, but since the range of any radar is limited by the size of its antenna, simply using the missile&apos;s own radar would diminish the potential range considerably. These problems were solved in the AMRAAM by both putting a miniature active radar into the missile nose for use in the missile&apos;s terminal phase, and also using a datalink from the launching fighter&apos;s Fire Control Radar (FCR) to provide mid-flight course corrections. Furthermore, the shooter doesn&apos;t need to continually paint the target with his radar to fire the AMRAAM, but can be in a more stealthy Track While Scanning (TWS) mode.
                
Engagement Sequence
An AMRAAM engagement from an F-16 begins with a radar lock on the desired target. This can be achieved from any air-to-air mode of the AN/APG-68. The dynamic launch zone on the HUD indicates whether the missile can produce enough kinetic energy to reach the target. When the range to the target falls within this zone, the missile can be fired. Obviously, the shorter the distance within the weapon engagement zone, the more confidence you can have in a shot. Once the missile is fired, data-linked signals from the FCR will guide the AMRAAM to a suitable activation point for intercepting the target. If the launching fighter drops its radar lock early, the AMRAAM will fly to a predicted activation point using an inertial navigation system and will turn on its radar. A large change in heading, speed or altitude by the target in the time between the shooter drops lock and missile activation could trash the missile. The time-to-activation is displayed on the lower right-hand corner of the F-16 HUD after an AMRAAM is fired. Once the missile goes active, the time to impact is displayed.
                
Tactics
Launch And Leave: This tactic is usually used to maintain separation between the launching fighters and the target bandits. After one or more AMRAAMs are fired, the flight turns cold, breaking radar lock and leaving the AMRAAMs to find their targets on their own.
                
Launch and Decide: This tactic is used to maintain separation from the target bandits for as long as possible, while still increasing the probability of a kill by maintaining a radar lock. After firing their AMRAAMs, the flight turns off target as far as it can while maintaining a lock at the edge of the radar gimbal limits.

The differences between the Aim-120B and Aim-120C-4 are as follows: The wings are now clipped with allows for carriage of the Aim-120C in weapons bays for aircraft such as the F/A-22 Raptor and the JSF. The Guidance was upgraded to the WGU-44/B standard and the warhead was improved to the WDU-41/B warhead. The engine was switched from a sustain/boost to a pure boost design. While it does cause the missile to loose some of it&apos;s range, it allows the missile to get out onto it&apos;s target quicker as the missile accelerates quicker than the previous versions that used the boost/sustain engine.
                
The Aim-120C-5 offers the following improvements over the Aim-120C-4 Has a slightly larger motor (pure boost) in the new WPU-16/B propulsion section A new shorter WCU-28/B control section with compressed electronics and ECCM upgrades. Deliveries began in July of 2000.

The Advanced Short Range Air to Air Missile is a state of the art highly maneuverable WVR dogfighting missile. The British Government spent 636 million pounds developing the project. The first ASRAAM was delivered to the RAF in 1998, and will equip the Tornado F3 and Harrier GR7 before it becomes the EF 2000&apos;s standard short range weapon.
                
The project started as a British-German collaboration in the 1980s. It was part of a wider agreement in which the US would develop the AIM-120 AMRAAM for medium-range use, while the ASRAAM would replace the Sidewinder with a design that would cover the great range disparity between Sidewinder and AMRAAM. Germany left the programme after examining the latest Soviet designs of the 1980s, however it was suggested that this was a smokescreen for financial and defence industrial share issues. The British proceeded on their own, and the missile was introduced into RAF service in 1998. It has since been selected to replace Sidewinder in the Royal Australian Air Force and is being introduced to the Indian Air Force. Parts of the missile have been used in the Common Anti-aircraft Modular Missile.

The Saab 37 Viggen (Swedish: Thunderbolt, but can also mean &quot;the Tufted Duck&quot;) was a Swedish single-seat, single-engine, short-medium range fighter aircraft and attack aircraft, manufactured between 1970 and 1990. Several variants were produced to perform the roles of all-weather fighter-interceptor, ground attack, and photo-reconnaissance, as well as a two-seat trainer.
                
The Viggen was initially developed as a replacement for the Saab 32 Lansen in the attack role and later the Saab 35 Draken as a fighter.[1] The first studies were carried out between 1952 and 1957 involving the legendary Finnish aircraft designer Aarne Lakomaa. Several different concepts were studied involving both single- and twin engines and also with separate lift engines, both simple and double delta wings and also with canard wings. Even VTOL designs were considered. The aim was to produce a robust aircraft with good short-runway performance that could be operated from numerous specially prepared roads and highways to reduce the vulnerability to attack in the event of war. Other requirements included supersonic ability at low level, Mach 2 performance at altitude, and the ability to make short landings at low angles of attack (to avoid damaging improvised runways).
                
To meet these design goals, Saab selected a radical configuration: a conventional delta wing with small, high-set canard wings. Canards have since become common in fighter aircraft, notably with the Eurofighter Typhoon and the IAI Kfir, but mainly for agility reasons rather than STOL capabilities. The final proposal was presented and accepted on 28 September 1962. Construction started in 1964, with a first prototype maiden flight on 8 February 1967.
                
The aircraft was also designed from the beginning to be easy to repair and service, even for personnel without much training.
                
In 1960 the U.S. National Security Council, led by President Eisenhower, formulated a military security guarantee for Sweden. The U.S. promised to help Sweden militarily in case of a Soviet attack against Sweden. As a consequence of this Sweden and the U.S. signed a military-technology agreement. In what was known as the &quot;37-annex&quot;, Sweden was allowed access to advanced U.S. aeronautical technology which made it possible to design and produce the Saab 37 Viggen much faster and cheaper than would otherwise have been possible.
                
The reason for this officially unexplained U.S. support was, according to the doctoral research of Nils Bruzelius at the Swedish National Defence College, the need to protect U.S. Polaris submarines deployed just outside the Swedish west coast against the threat of Soviet anti-submarine aircraft.

ALARM (Air Launched Anti-Radiation Missile) is a British anti-radiation missile designed primarily to destroy enemy radars for the purpose of Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD). It was used by the RAF and is still used by the Royal Saudi Air Force. The weapon was retired by the UK at the end of 2013
                
The ALARM may be launched in a standard ARM mode, climbing a bit, then homing in on the target. If the target emitter is turned off the missile homes in on the last known position.
                
The ALARM was in acceptance trials when the Gulf War broke out and was then rushed into operation in RAF. 121 ALARMs were fired and the results were as expected although there were a few defective missiles in the initial production batch. The steep climb in the loiter mode of operation did look a lot like a SAM lauch to near-by aircraft and ALARM capable aircraft were modified to transmit a coded signal to tell others that an ALARM was beeing launced.
                
ALARM has been used in the following conflicts:
                
1991 Gulf War (Operation Granby), during which 121 missiles were used.
Kosovo War (Operation Allied Force), during which 6 missiles were used.
2003 invasion of Iraq (Operation Telic), during which 47 missiles were used.

The Umbani is a precision-guided bomb kit manufactured by Denel Dynamics in South Africa. It consists of a number of modules fitted to NATO standard Mk81, Mk82 or Mk83 low drag free-fall bombs to convert them into guided glide bombs.
                
The modular kit consists of a number units that are attached to a standard Mk80-series bomb. A guidance system and large tail fins are the most basic form of the system, optional folding wings and a rocket motor may be added to increase the stand-off range up to 120 kilometres (75 mi) or add a low-level launch capability.
                
Range using different configurations:
    Standard bomb kit - 40 km
    With folding wing kit - 120 km
    With wing kit and Extended Range (ER) module - 200 km 
                
The system was first tested on the Atlas Cheetah, later an Aerosud-owned former South African Air Force (SAAF) Dassault Mirage F1 was used after the Cheetah retired. The system has been integrated on the SAAF's BAE Hawk Mk120 lead-in fighter trainer aircraft. Qualification on the SAAF's Saab JAS 39 Gripen was not considered due to the high costs associated with integration on a supersonic aircraft. The Gripens have been armed with GBU-12 Paveway II bombs instead.

Exocet missiles started in development in 1967, originally as the ship-launched variant MM 38 which entered service in 1975. The air-launched version, AM 39, was developed later starting in 1974 and entering service with the French Navy in 1979. The missile is designed to attack large warships. A block 2 upgrade programme was carried out from the late 1980s until 1993, and introduced an improved digital active radar seeker and upgraded inertial navigation and control electronics.
                
The Exocet has four clipped delta wings at mid-body and four raked clipped-tip moving delta control fins at the rear. The missile is 4.7 m long, has a body diameter of 350 mm and a wingspan of 1.1 m. The missile weighs 670 kg and has a 165 kg HE shaped charge fragmentation warhead. Guidance in the mid-course phase is inertial, followed by an active radar terminal phase. There is also a radar altimeter to control the sea-skimming trajectory, at around 10.0 m until the terminal phase when, in calm sea conditions, the missile can descend to 3.0 m or so. The solid propellant motor gives Exocet a range of about 50 km, but when released from 10,000 m (32,800 ft) the range achieved was reported to be 70 km.

An ammunition ship is an auxiliary ship specially configured to carry ammunition, usually for naval ships and aircraft. An ammunition ship's cargo handling systems, designed with extreme safety in mind, include ammunition hoists with airlocks between decks, and mechanisms for flooding entire compartments with sea water in case of emergencies. Ammunition ships most often deliver their cargo to other ships using underway replenishment, using both connected replenishment and vertical replenishment. To a lesser extent, they transport ammunition from one shore-based weapons station to another.

First built in the Soviet Union in the 1940s, this is one of the few biplanes that is still in military service. This aircraft has no armor or weapons and has an extremely limited speed and ceiling. Given the Colt&apos;s small Radar Cross Section (RCS), it&apos;s made mostly out of wood and cloth, and its ability to hedgehop, it is probable that North Korea will use the AN-2 to insert special forces into South Korea at the onset of a war.

The An-24 is a basic transport capable of carrying up to 50 troops or about 17,000 lbs. of cargo. However, it has limited capabilities in all other areas. Its speed is less than that of most jet-powered ground attack craft, and it has a ridiculously short range. These planes are extremely vulnerable in the air, but if they are properly escorted the supplies and troops they carry can cause their enemies considerable difficulty on the ground. The An-24 is still manufactured in China and is used throughout Africa, the Middle East, Russia and Asia.

Designed in the 1970s as successor to the same bureau&apos;s An-22 in the heavy logistic transport and strategic airlifter roles, the An-124 was sized to be able to lift a whole SS-20 &quot;Saber&quot; missile system in a single load.
The first of two prototypes flew in December 1982, and the type entered service in January 1986 as a truly prodigious machine of typical transport configuration with a hold 118 ft 1 in (36.00 m) long, 21 ft (6.40 m) wide and 14 ft 5 in (4.40 m) high. The roof of the hold has two longitudinal traveling gantries, each rated at 22,046 lbs (10,000 kg), and fitted with two transverse moving winches, each rated at 11,023 lbs (5,000 kg), and like the comparable but smaller Lockheed C-5 Galaxy the An-124 is designed for straight-through loading from the hydraulically operated rear ramp/door to the upward-hinged visor nose.
The type is also notable for its good field performance, which is attributable to the advanced landing gear and the wing high-left devices. The tricycle landing gear includes a side-by-side pair of twin-wheel nose units, and the main unit on each side comprises a longitudinal row of five independent twin-wheel units that retract into external fairings. The high-lift devices include three-section single-slotted Fowler flaps over much of each trailing edge and six-section flaps over the full span of each leading edge, all operated via a fly-by-wire control system that also controls the ailerons, spoilers, rudder and elevators.

Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night, or LANTIRN, is a combined navigation and targeting pod system for use on the USAF's premier fighter aircraft  the F-15E Strike Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon (Block 40/42 C and D models). LANTIRN significantly increases the combat effectiveness of these aircraft, allowing them to fly at low altitudes, at night and under-the-weather to attack ground targets with a variety of precision-guided weapons. 
                
The AN/AAQ-13 navigation pod provides high-speed penetration and precision attack on tactical targets at night and in adverse weather. The navigation pod also contains a terrain-following radar and a fixed thermographic camera, which provides a visual cue and input to the aircraft's flight control system, enabling it to maintain a pre-selected altitude above the terrain and avoid obstacles. This sensor displays an infrared image of the terrain in front of the aircraft, to the pilot, on a Head-up display. The navigation pod enables the pilot to fly along the general contour of the terrain at high speed, using mountains, valleys and the cover of darkness to avoid detection. The pod was the USAF's first wide-field, forward looking infrared navigation system for air superiority fighters. A downgraded version for export with the terrain-following radar deleted is designated as the AN/AAQ-20 Pathfinder, which is only capable of providing a visual cue/picture of ground features in darkness and adverse weather generated by the infrared sensor, and pilots must rely on their own skill to avoid ground obstacles at low altitude flight.
                
The LANTIRN system consists of two externally mounted pods(AN/AAQ-14 targeting pod and AN/AAQ-13 navigation pod) which provide a Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR), terrain-following radar and a laser target designator. Targeting data from the system can be handed off to various weapons for attack. Only a few LANTIRN systems are in inventory, used primarily on the F-15E.

The AN/AAQ-14 targeting pod contains a high-resolution, forward-looking infrared sensor (which displays an infrared image of the target to the pilot), a laser designator-rangefinder for precise delivery of laserguided munitions, a missile boresight correlator for automatic lock-on of AGM-65D imaging infrared Maverick missiles, and software for automatic target tracking. For a Maverick missile, the pod automatically hands the target off to the missile for launch with pilot consent. For a laser-guided bomb, the pilot aims the laser designator, and the bomb guides to the target. For a conventional bomb, the pilot can use the laser to determine range, then the pod feeds the range data to the aircraft&apos;s fire control system. The designator is a four-digit PRF-coded laser that can designate for its own weapons or for other acquisition devices or munitions. These features simplify the functions of target detection, recognition and attack and permit pilots of single-seat fighters to attack targets with precision-guided weapons on a single pass.

The AN/AAQ-28(V) LITENING targeting pod is an Israeli-designed precision targeting pod system currently operational with a wide variety of combat aircraft. LITENING significantly increases the combat effectiveness of the aircraft during day, night and under-the-weather conditions in the attack of ground and air[1] targets with a variety of standoff weapons (i.e., laser-guided bombs, conventional bombs and GPS-guided weapons). The thousandth pod was sold in October 2010.
LITENING is an integrated targeting pod that mounts externally to the aircraft. The targeting pod contains a high-resolution, forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor that displays an infrared image of the target to the aircrew; it has a wide field of view search capability and a narrow field of view acquisition/targeting capability of battlefield-sized targets. The pod also contains a CCD camera used to obtain target imagery in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. An on-gimbal inertial navigation sensor establishes line-of-sight and automatic boresighting capability.
The pod is equipped with a laser designator for precise delivery of laser-guided munitions. A laser rangefinder provides information for various avionics systems, for example, navigation updates, weapon deliveries and target updates. The targeting pod includes an automatic target tracker to provide fully automatic stabilized target tracking at altitudes, airspeeds and slant ranges consistent with tactical weapon delivery maneuvers. These features simplify the functions of target detection and recognition, and permit attack of targets with precision-guided weapons on a single pass.

The Lockheed Martin AN/AAS-35(V) Pave Penny is a laser spot tracker carried by US Air Force attack aircraft and fighter-bombers to enable them to track a laser spot on the ground (it does not produce a laser beam itself, so the aircraft cannot launch and guide laser-guided bombs against ground targets without additional hardware). PAVE was later used as an acronym for Precision Avionics Vectoring Equipment.
                
The Pave Penny was developed in the mid-1970s based on the earlier AN/AVQ-11 Pave Sword laser tracker used on a few USAF F-4 Phantom II during the Vietnam War, miniaturized using solid-state electronics.
                
The compact (31 in / 78 cm) pod, which weighs only 32 lb (14.5 kg) is a simple laser spot tracker that searches for reflected laser light from other laser designators (used by friendly air or ground forces) and displays that target information on the aircraft heads-up display (HUD). Unlike the laser ranger and marked target seeker systems common to European aircraft, or the more sophisticated ASQ-228 ATFLIR, TIALD, and LANTIRN designators, the Pave Penny does not contain a laser. It can recognize specific laser designation signals based on pre-determined four-digit codes encoded into the laser pulse, allowing it to seek out particular targets and ignore others (to avoid, for example, several aircraft hitting the same target). There is no range-finding capability. The Pave Penny&apos;s nominal range is 20 miles (32 km), although effective range is considerably shorter.
                
The Pave Penny pod was used by USAF A-7D Corsair II aircraft, fuselage-mounted beneath the engine intake, and the A-10 Thunderbolt II, mounted on an external pylon designed specifically for the pod. It was previously used by some F-16 aircraft, although most now use the LANTIRN system instead. Some pods were also supplied to Singapore, where they are used on that nation&apos;s A-4SU Super Skyhawks.

The Lockheed Martin AN/AAS-38 &quot;Nitehawk&quot; is a FLIR &amp; laser designation &amp; tracker pod system for use with laser-guided munitions.
The &quot;Nighthawk&quot; has been used with the F/A-18 Hornet, and has presumably been tested with the A-7E Corsair II. The Lockheed Martin [ex Loral ex Ford Aerospace] AAS-38A/B Nite Hawk forward-looking infrared (FLIR) is the Night Attack Hornet [F/A-18C and F/A-18D] Laser Target Designation (LTD) system for laser-guided munitions delivery. Mounted on the port fuselage (Station 4), the AAS-38 enhances the Hornet&apos;s night attack capability by providing real-time Forward Looking Infrared [FLIR] thermal imagery displayed on one of the cockpit CRTs and HUD. The AAS-38 FLIR can be fully integrated with other Hornet avionics, and data from the unit is used for the calculation of weapons release solutions. Only four of these were available during the Gulf War, seeing service with VMFA(AW)-121. The improved AAS-38A Laser Target Designator/Rangefinder (LTD/R) was cleared for Fleet service on Hornet-C/Ds in January 1993. The Martin-Marietta ASQ-173 Laser Detector Tracker/CAMera (LDT/CAM), a derivative of the Air Force PAVE PENNY pod, does not have the ability to laser designate targets. It is a passive tracking device that detects laser light reflected from targets illuminated by ground troops, other aircraft or the Hornet&apos;s own AAS-38 targeting FLIR on the other side of the fuselage. The ASQ-173 relays target location information to the cockpit displays and mission computers.
The AAS-38 pod came in 2 varieties: The AAS-38 (non LASER Designator/TV FLIR only) AAS-38A LASER Target Designator/Ranger (LTD/R). The LASER Spot Tracker (LST) capability came from the use of the ASQ-173 pod. The AAS-38A and ASQ-173 pods are meant to be used together to be able to Designate for Laser Guided Weapons (Example: GBU-12) and &quot;see&quot; another source&apos;s LASER designator (LST capability of the ASQ-173 pod. The AN/AAS-38A is commonly referred to by the US Navy as TFLIR or Targeting FLIR. The AAS-38 pod system, as of May 2008, is being phased out and replaced by the ASQ-228 ATFLIR pod. This will be a sequential replacement as the ATFLIR pods become available. The introduction of the ATFLIR is seen as a significant capability increase in all Hornet US Navy fleet aircraft.

The AN/ALQ-99 Tactical Jamming System is the first fully integrated computer controlled support jamming system. The AN/ALQ-99 intercepts and automatically processes radar signals and power manages the system&apos;s transmitters to effectively jam large numbers of diverse radar threats with very high effective radiated power (ERP). Since the deployment in the early 1970&apos;s aboard US Marine Corps and US Navy carrier-based EA-6B Prowler aircraft, the system has undergone multiple upgrades. The EA-6B/ALQ-99 combination has become an indispensable fleet asset, fully integrated into all air wing combat missions.
                
The AN/ALQ-99 Tactical Jamming System (TJS) onboard system includes the receiver, processor, and aircrew interfaces. The TJS also includes a selection of mission-configured jammer pods carried as external stores. Each jammer pod contains a ram air turbine generator, two selectable transmitter modules with associated antennas, and a universal exciter which is interfaced with and controlled by the onboard system and aircrew. The modular open architecture of the jammer system, which facilitates optimizing transmitters and antennas for a given frequency range, also facilitates tailored mission configurations.
                
The AN/ALQ-99(V) Receiver Processor Group (RPG) system was developed for use in the severe interference environment of the EA-6B jamming aircraft. The RPG had completed Operational Assessment and obtained a recommendation for production before program cancellation in 1993. Six RPG EDM systems were delivered. The AN/ALQ-99 RPG provided precision direction finding, passive ranging, identification, and threat warning, and was intended for the Navy EA-6B ADVCAP aircraft in very dense environments and in the presence of onboard jamming. This system included look-through, look-above, and look-around techniques to control the interference, as well as processing algorithms to contend with the resulting fragmented pulse data. The RPG performed surveillance, radar warning, and countermeasures management in support of standoff and escort jamming missions. The system uses four quadrants of AZ/EL interferometer arrays for full azimuth coverage precision monopulse DF measurement. The receiver is a narrowband channelizer cued receiver architecture with a wide instantaneous bandwidth and multiple cued narrowband channels for simultaneous pulse measurement capability. The RPG performed real time lookthrough control of the ALQ-99 jammers to accomplish all required threat emitter detection and measurement functions without degrading jammer effectiveness. To achieve this, data processing algorithms were developed with lookthrough samples providing as little as 1% of an emitter&apos;s pulses.

The AN/ALQ-101 is noise and repeater jammer and was one of the US Air Force&apos;s most widely used jamming pods; it has also been supplied abroad. The project began in 1966 and was referred to as Sesame Seed. Five examples of a development pod, designated QRC-335A/101-1, were developed, each with fore- and aft-facing antennas and operating in the 2 to 8 GHz frequency range. The last upgrade of the AN/ALQ-101 evolved into the AN/ALQ-119.

The AN/ALQ-119 is an external pod mounted, active, dual-mode noise and deception jammer.        
The AN/ALQ-119 is follow on from the AN/ALQ-101 noise and repeater jammer.
The AN/ALQ-119 covered the E-J bands (approx. 2 to 20 GHz).
                
First combat use in 1972.  Used by Germany, Japan and Turkey, Egypt, Israel and the USA.  
The AN/ALQ-119 - AN/ALR-46 combination was called Compass Tie
                
The Westinghouse AN/ALQ-119 jammer pod is currently carried on the F-16 and A-10, and previously carried on the F-4 prior to that aircraft&apos;s retirement. During the Vietnam War the ALQ-119 was carried on the F-4, typically frequently mounted on the inboard station, though subsequently it was frequently mounted on the Left Forward Aim-7 missile station. This noise/deception jammer covered three frequency bands. Current AN/ALQ-119 maintenance activities include programming of new threats and techniques to the system, system performance laboratory testing, threat and weapon systems analysis and technique development, and field support for various range testing of the system.

The AN/ALQ-131 Electronic Countermeasures Pod provides electronic countermeasures protection for USAF, ANG, AFRES, and FMS country aircraft. The AN/ALQ-131 is certified on the F-16, F-111, A-10, F-4, F-15, F-5 and C-130 aircraft. The ALQ-131 ECM Pod is modular in design containing various electronic receivers, antennas, and powerful transmitters designed to alter the flight path of an incoming enemy missile. This modular pod-mounted system can be configured to cope with a range of threats, spread over one to five frequency bands, by selecting individual modules for inclusion in the pod, the userthe pod to handle threats. Both noise and deception-jamming modes are available, and he pod can be reprogrammed to match the expected threat. The pod is controlled from the cockpit by both automatic and manual means. The cockpit control indicator is used to turn the system on, enable threat response actions, and display system status. ECM pods are pre-programmed on the ground for specific threats that may be encountered [ ...they also double as a pretty darn good microwave oven!].
                
The ALQ-131 pod contributes to full-dimensional protection by improving individual aircraft probability of survival. The ALQ-131 Block II is an upgraded version of a pod configured ECM system first fielded in the 1970s. The pod provides self protection jamming for USAF tactical fighter aircraft and is designed to operate in a dense, hostile environment of radar directed (RF) threats that require high duty cycle (pulse doppler) or CW jamming techniques. The ALQ-131 Block II is modularly constructed, providing a high degree of adaptability to various mission requirements. Basic hardware components include an Interface and control module, 2 or 3 Band modules that cover a portion of the pod&apos;s total frequency range, and the Receiver/Processor (R/P) module. The R/P module combines an accurate signal identification capability with power management. An important function of the R/P is the management of &quot;look through&quot; which permits periodic surveillance of the threat environment while jamming is in progress. This system is no longer in production for U.S. forces and is well past IOC. Operational Flight Program (OFP) Block software up-dates are expected about every two years, or as tactically required based on the continuum of threat evaluation to support theater tailored User Data Files (UDF), and jammer technique optimization.

The AN/ALQ-184 Electronic Attack Pod provides self-protection for the F-16 combat aircraft and crew in a complex radar guided threat environment. Built by Raytheon E-Systems for the Air Force, the AN/ALQ-184 protects aircraft against radio frequency threats by selectively directing high power jamming against multiple emitters. In 1995 Raytheon&apos;s Goleta, California, electronic warfare operation, which builds the AN-ALQ-184, was combined with the company&apos;s E-Systems division.
                
Between 1989 and 1996 Raytheon delivered more than 850 pods to the US Air Force, including a 1993 award for 78 pods. During 1996 the US Air Force awarded contracts totaling $28 million to upgrade and improve the AN/ALQ-184 electronic countermeasures pod, bringing total value of that program since its inception to more than $1.2 billion. In April 1996 the US Air Force awarded Raytheon E-Systems a $5.2 million contract for the ALQ-184(V)9 Pod Program, under which Raytheon will modify ten pods to incorporate two previously stand alone self- protection systems. This integrated system will be produced by installing the AN/ALE-50 Towed RF Decoy into the AN/ALQ-184 ECM Pod. Additional modifications will enhance the combined performance of the pod and decoy. The modification provides the US Air Force with the most capable full-band self-defense suite available today. The system can be installed on nearly all tactical aircraft, with no changes to the airplane and will add a measure of effectiveness not available elsewhere. The ALQ-184(V9) production program continues the integration of the ALE-50 towed decoy system in a 3-band ALQ-184(V9) ECM pod. The ALE-50 towed decoy system cannot be carried on F-16 Block 25/30 aircraft without this modification.
                
In May 1994 it was announced that Raytheon will upgrade Taiwan&apos;s of F-16s with AN/ALQ-184 ECM pods. The contract, worth nearly $106 million includes 82 pods and support equipment and spares, marked the first foreign sale of the AN/ALQ-184.

Name: AN/ASQ-213 
Type: HARM Targeting Pod
Manufacture: Raytheon
Initial Operation Capability(IOC): 2006
			</CategoryDescription>
		</CategoryData>
		<DescriptionData>
The AN/ASQ-213 HARM Targeting Systems (HTS) Pod has opened up a whole new mission for the F-16. With HARM/HTS, the F-16 picked up the demanding mission of suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD), once performed primarily by the F-4G Wild Weasel aircraft. The F-16 is truly a multirole unit in addition to the primary SEAD mission, it also flies air superiority, defense counter air, and air interdiction missions. Originally developed by Texas Instruments under a program to provide new modular targeting systems for USAF aircraft, it is the key to USAF&apos;s effort in SAM hunting now and in the 21st century. The pod is 8 inches in diameter, 56 inches long and weighs 85 pounds. Most important of the HTS&apos; capabilities is the ability to rapidly generate ranges to target radars, as well as to provide greater discretion between different types of enemy radars.
The retirement of the F-4G &quot;Wild Weasel&quot; has affected SEAD most. F/A-18s, EA-6Bs, and F-16s equipped with the HARM Targeting System have independent targeting capability similar to that of the F-4G, but with less coverage in both frequency and location. Although F-18s and EA-6Bs are HARM capable, the F-16 provides the ability to use the HARM in its most effective mode. The original concept called for teaming the F-15 Precision Direction Finding (PDF) and the F-16 HTS. Because this teaming concept is no longer feasible, the current approach calls for the improvement of the HTS capability. The improvement will come from the Joint Emitter Targeting System (JETS), which facilitates the use of HARM&apos;s most effective mode when launched from any JETS capable aircraft.

		</CategoryData>
		<DescriptionData>
The AN/ASQ-228 Advanced Targeting Forward-Looking Infrared (ATFLIR) is a multi-sensor, electro-optical targeting pod incorporating thermographic camera, low-light television camera, target laser rangefinder/laser designator, and laser spot tracker developed and manufactured by Raytheon. It is used to provide navigation and targeting for military aircraft in adverse weather and using precision-guided munitions such as laser-guided bombs. It is intended to replace the earlier AN/AAS-38 Nite Hawk pod in US Navy service.
                
ATFLIR is 72 in (183 cm) long, weighs 420 lb (191 kg), and has a slant range of 40 mi (64.3 km), said to be useful at altitude of up to 50,000 ft (15,240 m). It has fewer parts than many previous systems, which is intended to improve serviceability (although early examples, in service with VFA-115 &apos;Eagles&apos; in 2003 experienced problems). Crews indicate that it offers much greater target resolution and image accuracy than previous systems.
                
ATFLIR presently is used only by the US Navy on the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and the earlier F/A-18C/D and with Marine F/A-18Cs when deployed onboard aircraft carriers. It is normally carried on one of the fuselage hardpoints otherwise used for AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles. 410 pods were delivered to the U.S. Navy. Pods have also been delivered to Switzerland and Australia, and six pods will be delivered to Malaysia.

Origin: USA
Name: AN/AWW-13
Type: Data Link 
Manufacture: 
Initial Operation Capability(IOC): 
			</CategoryDescription>
		</CategoryData>
		<DescriptionData>
The AN/AWW-13 Advanced Data Link allows the operator to select an aimpoint for weapon impact, and provides the only currently available link between munition seekers and humans. This link generally requires electro-optical/infrared acquisition in clear weather.
The Mil-Std-1553 interface is used between the launch platform and the missile. Man-in-the-loop controls from the stick and throttle are sent through a 1553 bus to the AWW-13 data-link pod on the controlling aircraft. The AWW-13 pod transmits these RF signals to the missile under flight to allow slewing and designation of the track point of the missile. The missile data-link transmitter sends the seeker scene back to the AWW-13 data link pod on the controlling aircraft. The AWW13 pod then relays this scene up to the cockpit video display.
                
During the 1999 Operation Allied Force, the Rapid Targeting System (RTS) sent target information and imagery directly to the cockpit of F/A-18 fighter aircraft. The aircraft receive RTS target information through the AWW-13 video data link pod. The pilots can view printed messages, charts, U2 photos, and even video from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) currently on station. The aircraft use the imagery to mission-plan enroute when retasked. Once the target packages were constructed, a high-bandwidth land line was used to transport the package to a geographically separated communications relay site where it was uplinked to specially modified AN/AWW-13 pods on the F/A-18 aircraft. Once uploaded, the back seat weapons officer on the aircraft could cue, review, and mission plan using the information provided in the target package.
The Standoff Land Attack Missile-Expanded Response (SLAM-ER) missile navigates with its GPS/Inertial Navigation System (INS) toward the target location. It can also receive midcourse updates from the F/A-18 aircraft via the AWW-13 data link pod. These quick-reaction launch and midcourse update features are part of the Target of Opportunity (TOO) mode of SLAM-ER, which can be used against ships at sea or those transiting through littoral areas. The AWW-13 Data Link POD hsa been tested on the Navy&apos;s S-3B to support fleet demonstration of S-3B control of the Standoff Land Attack Missile.
                
The AWW-13 has a Command, Control &amp; Communications: data link mission. The loss of the L band would impair the operations of Navy missile command and guidance telemetry systems, ultimately affecting weapon system testing and training. Navy pilots adhere to the &quot;train as we will fight&quot; policy when training and testing airborne weapons systems. The normal test and training missions are conducted at an altitude of 36,000 feet. At this altitude, the weapons are well within line-of-sight of adjacent, major metropolitan areas. Missiles in the inventory have factory-fixed frequencies of operation within the L band and their expected service life runs well into the next century.
The L band is used for proficiency training using various guided weapon systems. The weapon systems and supporting data links that operate in this band include the AWW-13 Advanced Data Link, used in the Walleye and SLAM. The current Navy inventory includes approximately 200 Walleye and 800 SLAM weapon systems. The loss of this band for missile command operations will render Navy systems more susceptible to jamming, and will impair their terminal guidance. Compounding the problem are weapons in development that are planning to use the AWW-13, including the Joint Standoff Weapon Unitary (JSOW Unitary). The AWW-13 requires spectrum for both command and video functions.
                
The Navy identified two options for dealing with the loss of the L band for the weapon and data link systems,: (1) change the frequency band of operation for the AWW-13 and associated weapons, or (2) develop a new digital video link with frequency agility or spread spectrum techniques, and apply advanced data compression techniques. Both of these options would require significant financial and technical investments for development and retrofit of both weapon and pod subsystems. The Navy estimates that development time could conceivably take two to five-years depending on the alternatives considered, with retrofit taking several additional years. Either of these options would also result in a negative impact on weapons acquisition and maintenance budgets, and weapon inventory readiness.
The low cost associated with the reallocation of this spectrum to accommodate missile control systems and precision strike operations will be $67M. This estimate (for option 1) makes the optimistic assumption that suitable spectrum will be available for relocation, that current equipment can be retuned, and that extensive system modifications will not be required in order to operate on new frequencies or to avoid interfering with new commercial users. If replacement of the data link system is required (option 2), development and procurement costs would be approximately $170M.

			</CategoryDescription>
		</CategoryData>
		<DescriptionData>
The AN/AXQ-14 Data Link System provides a two-way communications system that turns the GBU-15, an unpowered 2,000-pound &quot;glide bomb&quot; or its powered successor, the AGM-130, into a precision guided weapon that can be controlled from the launch aircraft or a surveillance aircraft. The bomb can be &quot;steered&quot; to the target by a weapons control officer monitoring a display from a specially designed television camera or an infrared sensor in the bomb&apos;s nose.
Hughes began development of the AXQ-14 data link system in the mid-1970s and updated the system in the 1980s. The first production unit was delivered April 16, 1982 from Hughes&apos; manufacturing facilities in California. The work was moved to Hughes&apos; Orangeburg subsidiary, Hughes Aircraft - South Carolina, in 1993. The first of 128 South-Carolina-built systems was delivered last August, continuing a nine-year record of making all contractual deliveries on or ahead of schedule.
                
The system includes the weapon data link, an aircraft-mounted data link pod that provides guidance for the GBU-15/AGM-130, and a cockpit control unit for the weapon systems operator. The system is operational on USAF F-111s and F-15s and can be adapted to B-52s, F-16s, F/A-18s and other non-U.S. aircraft.
With more than 400 launches accomplished as of early 1995, the AXQ-14 had demonstrated better than 99 percent launch success rate and a mean time between failure rate which exceeded the specification by 300 percent. On 03 April 1995, nearly 13 years after the first delivery, Hughes Aircraft Company turned over to the US Air Force its 3,000th production AN/AXQ-14 Data Link System.

The AN/MPQ-46 HPI (High-Power Illuminator) is the target illumination radar for the HAWK missile system. The radar uses Continuous Wave radiation (CW), and so must have both a send and receive dish. The HAWK system has two search radars which hand off targets to the HPI. The HPI then automatically tracks the target, maintaining radar illumination for the HAWK missile. The HAWK missile guides directly on the radar reflection from the target and receives no separate guidance commands. The HPI also has an optical sight which allows the operator to manually track a target even when automatic tracking is jammed.

The assembly consists of several antenna arrays, which perform various functions including surveillance, tracking, IFF, sending command guidance signals, receiving signals from the missile and canceling radar side lobes (making the radar more difficult to jam). The AN/MPQ-53 can simultaneously track up to 125 targets and guide 9 missiles to final engagement. The range of the radar depends on target RCS and altitude, but is rated at 100nm. During the Gulf War, Patriot operators using the AN/MPQ-53 were able to detect incoming SCUD missiles at 54nm.
                
AN/MSQ-104
The AN/MSQ-104 is the Engagement Control Station (ECS) of the Patriot ADS. It is mounted on a trailer. For each Patriot battery there is one ECS. The AN/MPQ-53 and the ECS are mounted on the same trailer.

The AN/MSQ-104 Engagement Control Station is the command and control unit of the entire Patriot system. The MSQ-104 has a crew of 3. The MSQ-104 control station is connected with the launching stations through VHF data links, the MPQ-53 radar set, with other Patriot batteries and with the command headquarters. Inside the MSQ-104, Patriot&apos;s computer in conjunction with the operators carry out the air defense missions.
                
AN/MSQ-104 Engagement Control Station (ECS) is the only manned station in the Patriot battery and requires three operators. Inside are two operator console positions, one communications station, the digital weapons control computer, the VHF datalink terminal, three radio relay terminals and the battery status panel with a hardcopy unit beneath. The main sub-components of the ECS are the Weapons Control Computer (WCC), the Data Link Terminal (DLT), the UHF communications array, the Routing Logic Radio Interface Unit (RLRIU), and the two manstations that serve as the system&apos;s man-to-machine interface. The ECS is air conditioned, pressurized (to resist chemical/biological attack), and shielded against electromagnetic pulse (EMP) or other such electromagnetic interference. The ECS also contains several SINCGARS radios to facilitate voice communications.
                
The WCC is the main computer within the Patriot system. It is a 24-bit parallel militarized computer with fixed and floating point capability. It is organized in a multiprocessor configuration that operates at a maximum clock rate of 6 megahertz. This computer controls the operator interface, calculates missile intercept algorithms, and provides limited fault diagnostics. Compared to modern personal computers, it has somewhat limited processing power, although it has been upgraded several times during Patriot&apos;s service life.
The DLT connects the ECS to Patriot&apos;s Launching Stations. It uses either a SINCGARS radio or fiber optic cables to transmit encrypted data between the ECS and the launchers. Through the DLT, the system operators can remotely emplace, slew or stow launchers, perform diagnostics on launchers or missiles, and fire missiles.
                
The UHF communications array consists of three UHF radio &quot;stacks&quot; and their associated patching and encrypting equipment. These radios are connected to the antennas of the OE-349 Antenna Mast Group, which are used to create UHF &quot;shots&quot; between sister Patriot batteries and their associated ICC. This creates a secure, real-time data network (known as PADIL, Patriot Data Information Link) that allows the ICC to centralize control of its subordinate firing batteries.
                
The RLRIU functions as the primary router for all data coming into the ECS. The RLRIU gives a firing battery an address on the battalion data network, and sends/receives data from across the battalion. It also &quot;translates&quot; data coming from the WCC to the DLT, facilitating communication with the launchers.

The Arleigh Burke class of guided missile destroyers (DDGs) is a United States Navy class of destroyer built around the Aegis Combat System and the SPY-1D multifunction passive electronically scanned array radar. The class is named for Admiral Arleigh Burke, an American destroyer officer in World War II, and later Chief of Naval Operations. The lead ship, USS Arleigh Burke, was commissioned during Admiral Burke's lifetime.
                
These warships were designed as multimission destroyers, able to fulfill the strategic land strike role with Tomahawk missiles; antiaircraft warfare (AAW) role with powerful Aegis radar and surface-to-air missiles; antisubmarine warfare (ASW) with towed sonar array, anti-submarine rockets, and ASW helicopter; and antisurface warfare (ASuW) with Harpoon missile launcher. With upgrades to their AN/SPY-1 phased radar systems and their associated missile payloads as part of the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System, the ships of this class have also begun to demonstrate some promise as mobile antiballistic missile and anti-satellite weaponry platforms. Some versions of the class no longer have the towed sonar, or Harpoon missile launcher. Their hull and superstructure were designed to have a reduced radar cross-section.
                
The first ship of the class was commissioned on 4 July 1991. With the decommissioning of the last Spruance-class destroyer, USS Cushing, on 21 September 2005, the Arleigh Burke-class ships became the U.S. Navy's only active destroyers, until the Zumwalt class became active in 2016. The Arleigh Burke class has the longest production run for any post-World War II U.S. Navy surface combatant. Besides the 62 vessels of this class (comprising 21 of Flight I, 7 of Flight II and 34 of Flight IIA) in service by 2016, up to a further 42 (of Flight III) have been envisioned.
                
With an overall length of 505 to 509 feet (154 to 155 m), displacement ranging from 8,315 to 9,200 tons, and weaponry including over 90 missiles, the Arleigh Burke class are larger and more heavily armed than most previous ships classified as guided missile cruisers.

The ARMAT missile is a development of the Anglo-French Martel anti-radar missile. The Martel was further developed by British Aerospace to give the Sea Eagle anti-ship missile, while Britain adopted ALARM for their new ARM missile. France instead adopted the Exocet as their anti-ship missile in the 1970s, and used the ARMAT as new anti-radar weapon. This missile is unusually slow and huge when compared to western anti-radar missiles, reflecting the original anti-ship task of the ancestor, the AS.37/AJ.168 Martel.
                
ARMAT is not well known in details. It is a two-stage solid propelled missile, highly subsonic, with a range up to 120 km. The warhead weighs 150 kg with proximity fuse and delayed impact. The ARMAT was operational since 1984. It was used as main, if not exclusive anti-radar weapon by French aviation, employed by SEPECAT Jaguars against Libyans during Operation Epervier. It was also used by Iraqi aviation against Iranian defences.
                
ARMAT is used on Mirage F.1, Mirage 2000 and some other French aircraft, but not with the new Dassault Rafale. An improved product, the MARS, was proposed in 1988. In early 1990s it seems that the basic ARMAT was upgraded with better electronic systems.
                
The Martel was built in two variants, a UK designed AJ.168 TV guided version and a French designed AS 37 anti-radiation version. The UK deployed both variants on the Buccaneer S.2B, primarily as maritime anti-ship weapons. The French deployed only the AS 37 on a number of Mirage subtypes, and the Jaguar.
                
An enhanced variant of the AS 37, designated the Armat (Anti Radiation MArTel), was developed in the early eighties, and deployed with the French Air Force in 1984, subsequently exported to Egypt, Kuwait and Iraq. The missile was reputedly used during the Iran-Iraq war to destroy Iranian radar sites, fired from the Mirage F.1 .
                
The Armat shares its basic airframe and propulsion with the AS 37 Martel. The Armat is a heavyweight among ARMs, weighting in at 1200 lb / round, with a 331 lb high explosive warhead, and with a fuselage length of 13.5 ft and diameter of 15.7 in. The large airframe accommodates a Hotchkiss-Brandt/SNPE Basile solid propellant boost stage with a 2.4 second burn, and an SNPE Cassandre solid propellant sustainer with a 22 second burn. The missile has a quoted range for a high altitude launch of about 50 NM.
                
Compared with the AS 37, the Armat has a significantly improved passive homing seeker designed in the early eighties by Dassault Electronique. The microprocessor based seeker will home on to a programmed emitter, be it a radar or a jammer, and uses inertial midcourse guidance.
                
With its high launch weight, heavyweight warhead and long range, the Armat is primarily an offensive strategic ARM designed to destroy Early Warning and Ground Control Intercept radars. This is where it differs fundamentally from the HARM and the ALARM, which are built to also perform as defensive ARMs carried as part of a mixed weapon load. As the missile is 50% heavier than the HARM, and twice the weight of the ALARM, it is unlikely to compete successfully against these newer missiles.

The Kh-22 (AS-4 'Kitchen') is a large, long-range anti-ship missile developed by MKB Raduga in the Soviet Union. It was intended for use against US Navy aircraft carriers and carrier battle groups, with either a conventional or nuclear warhead. 
                
The AS-4 comes in three variants:
1) The KH-22N, with a nuclear warhead and inertial guidance
2) The KH-22M, with a conventional warhead against ships and guidance by an active-radar during final phase of flight
3) The KH-22MP, for breaking through enemy air defenses.
                
Originally built for the Tu-22 and Tu-22M, the missile now also arms the modified Tu-95K-22 aircraft.
                
After analyzing World War II naval battles and encounters in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Soviet military thinkers concluded that the era of large seaborne battles was over, and that stand-off attacks would be the way to neutralize and incapacitate large battle groups without having to field a similar force against them. Substituting cruise missiles for air attacks, Soviet Air Forces and Soviet Naval Aviation commanders set about to convert their heavy bombers to raketonosets, or missile carriers, which could be launched against approaching enemy fleets from coastal or island airfields. The Kh-22 (Complex 22) weapon was developed by the Raduga design bureau and used to arm the Tupolev Tu-22M.

The Raduga KSR-5 (NATO reporting name AS-6 Kingfish) was a long-range, air-launched cruise missile and anti ship missile developed by the Soviet Union. It was essentially a scaled down version of the Kh-22 'Kitchen', built to be carried by the less capable Tu-16.
                
The AS-6 Kingfish is launched from the Tu-16 Badger. It is fielded in both active radar and passive radar homing versions. The missile can carry a conventional warhead or up to a 1 megaton nuclear charge.
                
The Raduga KSR-5 was deployed aboard such Soviet aircraft as the Tupolev Tu-16 'Badger' in Tu-16K-26, Tu-16KSR-2-5, and Tu-16KSR-2-5-11 variants, as well as the Tu-22M Backfire. Post 1991 with the retirement of the Badger, the KSR-5 warstock was converted into supersonic targets.

In April 1965, when work on the MiG-23 fighter aircraft began, the &quot;Vympel&quot; [Pennant] OKB-134 Special Design Bureau received an order for a Kh-23 tactical guided air-to-ground missile. The main incentive for developing it was intelligence received about the Bullpup missile, a highly effective American one of the same class built several years earlier. Right away the engineers faced an obstacle of technological nature: the Russians had never before built tactical guided missiles and had not acquired any experience
with missile guidance systems. A particularly difficult problem was the stipulation by the Air Force that the missile guidance system fit already existing fighter aircraft and thus be small. Because the OKB-134 did not meet time schedules, the Air Force in early 1966 accepted the proposal from the &quot;Zvezda&quot; small Design Bureau at the Kalinin No 455 Series Production Plant near Moscow producing K-5, K-8, and other guided air-to-air missiles. They proposed to build the first tactical air-to-ground missile with ready-made components of air-to-air missiles.
                
What prompted the &quot;Zvezda&quot; OKB to submit its proposal was that it already had certain experience in using air-to-air missiles against ground targets. Such tests had been conducted during late nineteen fifties and early nineteen sixties with K-51 (RS-2US) missiles fired from MiG-19PM fighter aircraft. The main results of these tests indicated the feasibility of using these missiles against land and sea targets, though not very effectively because of the small warhead.
                
The first Soviet tactical air-to-ground missile was built in 1966 and, therefore, called the Kh-66 or Article 66. The key design requirement was that it be able to carry a warhead weighing 100 kg (for comparison, the warhead of the K-5 missile weighed 13 kg). For propulsion of the Kh-66 missile the propulsion system of the K-8 was used with only a small modification of the nozzle. The nozzle had to be split in two, because the K-51 (RS-2US) guidance system, also used by the Kh-66 missile, was located in the tail.
Using the old guidance system had many drawbacks but also offered one great advantage, namely that it could be carried by every aircraft previously carrying a K-5 missile without modifications of the aircraft (except for a new attachment underneath the fuselage). The missile was produced within a few months
and in September 1966 began to be tested with an MiG-21PFM aircraft. Then in 1968 the Kh-66 was officially certified as weapon of MiG-21 aircraft, supported on the center line beneath the fuselage.
                
The Kh-66 missile was a temporary solution and therefore, work on the Kh-23 missile was not discontinued but transferred from the &quot;Vympel&quot; OKB to the &quot;Zvezda&quot; OKB.
                
Many components of the Kh-66 missile were used for building the Kh-23 and only the tail carrying the Delta-R1M radio-command guidance system had to be altered. Furthermore, the propulsion fuel was replaced with one having a higher energy content. The first ten experimental Kh-23 units were tested in the beginning of 1968. Due to defects, factory testing continued till the end of 1969. The cause of perturbations in the missile guidance could not be determined for quite a long time. Eventually the cause was found to be the wrong location of the smoke tracker allowing it to interfere both thermally and mechanically with the antenna of the guidance system. This problem was solved by placing the tracker
on the tail extension of the missile. The aircraft part of the Delta apparatus was installed either permanently on the aircraft (Delta N and Delta NM) or in containers (Delta NG or Delta NG2 systems).
After completion of Government Qualification tests on MiG-23S and MiG-23B aircraft in autumn 1973, the Kh-23 missile was in 1974 officially certified as weapon with the Kh-23M (Article 68M) designation.

The Item 117 / D7 / Kh-58 anti-radiation missile was developed during the 1970s to arm Soviet Frontal Aviation defence suppression aircraft, especially the newly developed MiG-25BM Foxbat. The design was clearly inspired by the joint UK-French developed HS-Matra Martel series, as the Soviet design is almost identical in configuration, cardinal design parameters and size. The Kh-58 was later integrated on other strike aircraft, specifically the Su-24 Fencer, the Su-17/22 Fitter, and Su-25 Frogfoot, these requiring an external emitter locating pod such as the Vyoga or Fantasmagoria. IOC was attained in 1982.
                
The Kh-58 airframe uses 30KhGSA stainless steel extensively, and OT4-1 titanium alloy is employed for the wings and tail surfaces. The Avtomatika PRGS-58 anti-radiation homing seeker is mounted in the nose, its generates steering signals for the SAU-58 guidance, which also uses inertial unit inputs for midcourse guidance. The 149 kg blast-fragmentation warhead employs an ROV-20 active laser proximity fuse with a backup contact fuse, both armed by the guidance unit. The rocket motor develops 6,000 kp of thrust during the initial boost/climb phase, and once this 3.6 sec burn is completed the sustain phase thrust rating of 1,000 kp is produced until burnout.
                
The Kh-58 can be carried externally using the AKU-58 launcher, or internally using the UKVU-50 ejector.
                
In a typical delivery profile the missile flies a semi-ballistic trajectory on inertial guidance, switching to passive anti-radiation homing as it nears the target emitter.
                
A number of distinct variants exist.
                
The baseline Kh-58 introduced during the Cold War had a cited range of up to 120 km.
                
It was replaced by the improved Kh-58U which had a better PGS-58M seeker and a range of up to 250 km for a high altitude supersonic launch.
                
The current production Kh-58E export variant has a range of 200 km, subject to launch conditions, and likely employs the engine developed for the Kh-58U. The weapon has been integrated on the new MiG-31BM Foxhound variant.
                
An anti-shipping variant equipped with an active radar seeker and analogous to the Matra-BAe Sea Eagle has been proposed.
                
The latest export variant offered is the Kh-58UShKE, which is slightly shorter than the Kh-58E, uses shorter span wings, and has a range of up to 245 km. It is equipped with a new wideband seeker design capable of acquiring emitters operating between 1.2 and 11 GHz, and can also home on CW (continuous wave) emitters in one band.
                
AS-11 Kilter anti-radar missile replaces the outdated AS-9 Kyle. The on-board &quot;Fantazmagoria&quot; (Phantasmagoria) of the SU-24M provides target indication and guidance programming prior to launch of the missile. This can also be done by the external &quot;Vyyuga&quot; (Snowstorm) system which is suspended in a container.
The probability of hit within a 20 m radius is 80%. The A model is equipped with an active radar to help homing in on the target.

The Kh-25P and more recent Kh-25MP variant are anti-radiation missiles based on the Kh-25M airframe. The are intended due to limited range primarily as reactive defensive weapons for suppression of terminal and battlefield air defences, especially SAM systems and SPAAGs.
                
The missile is equipped with a band specific PRGS-1VP or PRGS-2VP anti-radiation homing seeker. Post launch the missile seeker is programmed to climb along a logarithmic trajectory until the seeker depression angle to the target emitter is 27º, at which point the missile pitches down, transitions to terminal homing in azimuth and elevation, and dives into the target emitter.
                
The Kh-25 is typically operated in an LOBL regime, with the seeker capable of autonomous search while being carried on the APU-68 or APU-68UM launcher. The PRGS-1VP searches a 60º angular sector in azimuth for threat emitters, and once locked can track the emitter at a rate of up to 6º/s. The PRGS-2VP can track the emitter at a rate of up to 8º/s, through elevation angles of +20º to -40º.
                
Work began on the Kh-27PS (also known as the Kh-25MP) in 1972. It was intended for use specifically against Hawk and Nike radars. The AS-12 has a two-stage rocket motor to allow it to operate outside a 60km range. It can be carried by the Su-17 family, Su-24, and the Mig-27.

This is the only missile of the air-to-ground class which has been designed by Matus Bisnovat&apos;s &quot;Molniya&quot; [Lightning] Design Bureau, which specializes in air-to-air missiles. It was developed in the middle nineteen seventies for MiG-27, Su-17, and Su-24 (Fencer) aircraft. It was later also installed on other aircraft. It is used chiefly against heavily reinforced targets (almost half its weight is the warhead). It is supported on AKU-58 launcher pylons, from which it is dropped down before its engine starts. The Kh-29L (Article 63) is an improved version of the Kh-29, with semiactive laser guidance. A target can be illuminated from the delivery aircraft or from another aircraft or from the ground. The Kh-29T (Article 64) has a television head with automatic optical homing to a distinguishable object indicated by the pilot in the cockpit. The Kh-29D version with a thermal- imaging head is also on the list of Russian export items.
                
The Kh-29 entered service with the Soviet Air Force in 1980, and has been widely exported since.
The Kh-29L were used by Sukhoi Su-34 and Su-24 aircraft in the 2015 Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War.
                
2014 Libyan conflict
Libyan Su-24-borne Kh-29Ts supplied in large quantities to Muammar Gaddafis Jamahiriya have been used by Islamist factions against pro-government forces around Tripoli during the current low-level civil war (they were seized from Ghardabiya Air Base depots). Their use, however, was in an unguided ground-to-ground role, launched from modified trucks and with their fins and ailerons at the front and back removed for a somewhat more stable flight path.

The Kh-29 (Russian: X-29; NATO: AS-14 Kedge; GRAU: 9M721) is a Soviet air-to-surface missile with a range of 1030 km. It has a large warhead of 320 kg, has a choice of laser, infrared, active radar or TV guidance, and is typically carried by tactical aircraft such as the Su-24, Su-30, MiG-29K as well as the &quot;T/TM&quot; models of the Su-25, giving that craft an expanded standoff capability.
                
The Kh-29 is intended for primary use against larger battlefield targets and infrastructure such as industrial buildings, depots and bridges, but can also be used against ships up to 10,000 tonnes, hardened aircraft shelters and concrete runways.

		<DescriptionData>
The AS-15 Kent is a strategic cruise missile that carries a 200 kT nuclear warhead over a distance of up to 3000 km. It uses an inertial navigation system that updates its position by comparing contour features with stored image data.
                
It is powered by a single 400 kgf Ukrainian-made, Motor Sich JSC R95-300 turbofan engine, with pop-out wings for cruising efficiency. It can be launched from both high and low altitudes, and flies at subsonic speeds at low levels (under 110 m/300 ft altitude). After launch, the missile's folded wings, tail surfaces and engine deploy. It is guided through a combination of an inertial guidance system plus a terrain contour-matching guidance system which uses radar and images stored in the memory of an onboard computer to find its target. This allows the missile to guide itself to the target with a high degree of accuracy.
                
The original Kh-55 had a drop-down engine; the Kh-65SE had a fixed external turbojet engine, while the Kh-SD had its engine inside the body of the missile. Current-production versions are equipped with the increased power of 450 kgf Russian-made NPO Saturn TRDD-50A engine

The Raduga Kh-15 or RKV-15 (Russian: X-15; NATO: AS-16 &quot;Kickback&quot;) is a Russian hypersonic aero-ballistic missile carried by the Tupolev Tu-22M and other bombers. Originally a standoff nuclear weapon similar to the U.S. Air Force's AGM-69 SRAM, versions with conventional warheads have been developed.
                
As of early 2019, it was uncertain whether the Kh-15 was in service, with rumors that it had been retired or placed in storage.
                
The Kh-15 climbs to an altitude of about 40,000 m (130,000 ft) and then dives in on the target, accelerating to a speed of about Mach 5.

New air defense weapon systems of the American Patriot kind have raised the requirements which antiradar missiles must meet. These include first of all higher speed and longer range, then also high interference immunity and radar turn-off when attacked.
                
For the special purpose of meeting these requirements, the &quot;Zvezda&quot; group under the direction of V. Bugayskiy began in 1977 working on the Kh-31 missile (Article) 77P). The first launchings of this missile took place in 1982.
                
The most interesting component of the Kh-31P is its dual propulsion system designed by the &quot;Soyuz&quot; Design Bureau in Turayevo near Moscow (note: there are several &quot;Soyuz&quot; engineering groups in Russia). First the missile is accelerated by its solid-fuel rocket engine to a speed of Mach 1.8, then the engine is discarded and the interior of the missile is converted into the combustion chamber of the missile&apos;s jet engine. The latter accelerates the missile to a speed of almost Mach 4.5, while four air intake holes on the sides of the missile body open up. On the basis of the Kh-31P antiradar missile were developed the Kh-31A missile (Article 77A) with an active-radar guidance head and also an M-31 flying target for air defense training exercises. The Kh-31 was for the first time publicly displayed in November 1991, in Dubai (United Arab Emirates).
                
The State Scientific Production Center Zvezda-Strela has upgraded the air-to-surface supersonic ASM Kh-31A NATO: AS-17 Krypton). Recently a variant of the air-to-air class based on the Kh-31 was made available, equipped with a hybrid active-passive guidance head for use against nonmaneuvering airborne targets such as AWACS (passive guidance) from far distances. The range of this missile is 200 km. The unofficial designation of this missile is &apos;mini-Moskit&apos;. The Kh-31A missile has been developed from the technologies of the 1970-80s.

The Kh-59 missile (Article D9) was for the first time publicly displayed in November 1991, in Dubai (United Arab Emirates). This missile is guided by television and propelled by a powder-fuel engine, with a powder- fuel accelerator in the tail. Its folding stabilizers are located at the front, while its cantilever wings with rudders are located in the rear.
                
The Kh-59M missile differs from the original model by having a twice as large warhead and by another propulsion system. Under the missile body has been suspended a small turbojet engine, the RDK-300 designed by the &quot;Soyuz&quot; [Union] OKB. The missile is brought up to speed by a powder-fuel accelerator located in the tail section and then continues flying propelled by that turbojet engine. Equipped with such a propulsion system, the missile has a three times longer range than the Kh-59.
                
Because television guidance has the drawback that the target must be &quot;seen&quot; by the missile, which limits the missile&apos;s range of action, the Kh-59M has a dual guidance system. After having been fired, the missile is guided by an inertial navigation system into the vicinity of the target and then the television camera is turned on for transmission of images to the receiver on board the missile&apos;s carrier aircraft. The transmitter of flight-correcting radio commands (APK-8 for MiG-27K aircraft or APK-9 for Su-24M/30M and newer aircraft) is mounted in a container which hangs under the aircraft. The armament consisting of a Kh-59M missile with such guidance is called Owad [Insect]-M.

In 1972 the Zvezda-Strela State Scientific-Industrial Center (GNPTs) group began working on the Uran (Western SS-N-25) anti-ship missile system - also commonly called Kharpunskiy because of its similarity to the American Harpoon - for ships of various classes. The Kh-35 antiship cruise missile can be used by
surface ships and motor boats, coastal reconnaissance/strike systems, naval helicopters and also by Air Force planes.
                
The Uran missile systems comprise 16 Kh-35 missiles - 4x4 launchers with pressurised transportlaunching containers. The Uran system now serves as armament of Project 1149.8 missile equipped gun boats and other vessels. A coastal defense variant and, more recently, an antiaircraft variant were later developed on the basis of this missile.
                
The Kh-35 missile has a normal aerodynamic design and an aluminium-alloy airframe. The missile&apos;s power plant consists of a solid-fuel booster and a turbojet powerplant. The missile&apos;s take-off weight is 750 kilograms, the warhead weighs 150 kilograms with a range of up to 130 kilometres. The Kh-35U anti-ship aircraft missile (Article 78U), propelled by a turbojet engine, flies toward its target at a speed of about the 300 m/s at an extremely low altitude. Owing to its high-precision radio-altimeter, the missile can skim the
sea waves at an altitude of 3-5 metres at the terminal phase of trajectory. Its guidance system combines inertial guidance for during the initial flight stage and active-radar guidance during the remaining flight stage. The missile has a folding wing and a folding tail fin.
                
For use by coastal or shipborne launchers the missile is equipped with a rocket starter-accelerator, a container-type launcher having room for four missiles.
The air-launched AS-20 Kayak version was scheduled to become part of ordnance in 1994. The Kh-35U is intended to serve as weapon of practically all tactical naval aircraft, also of ZOP on the Tu-142 longrange aircraft (eight missiles on two positions, four per position, under the wings) and carrier-based Ka-27 helicopters (four missiles).

The AS-30 was an air-to-ground missile built by Nord Aviation. It was a precision attack weapon designed to be used against high-value targets such as bridges and bunkers. The AS-30 was essentially a larger version of the earlier AS-20 design, and initially used that weapon's guidance system, which required pilots to track the weapon visually and correct its path using a small joystick, while also flying their own aircraft. All such MCLOS systems proved very difficult to use in practice. The updated AS-30L replaced this system with a semi-active laser homing system, which allows the missile to fly to the target without operator intervention. About 60 AS-30Ls were launched during Operation Desert Storm and Operation Deliberate Force with great success.

The Kormoran combines range, accuracy, and hard-hitting power in one smooth, aerodynamic package. Air launched against ships or land targets, the Kormoran employs inertial guidance for cruising. When it reaches its target at the end of its 23 mile range, active radar homing takes over. Kormoran&apos;s 352 lb. warhead is delay fused, to allow it to penetrate up to 90mm of steel plate before detonating Kormoran 2 is the upgunned version of the successful Kormoran 1 guided missile. It has been adapted to the German Navy plane Tornado and can be deployed as a standoff weapon against surface vessels. The system utilizes top-notch seeker technology for target selection and works on the fire-and-forget principle; the range exceeds 30 kilometers.

The AS-37 was developed and produced by Matra (France) and Hawker-Siddely (UK). An   version, the AS 37 Armat, was introduced in 1984. It has an updated seeker head. Another shorter, TV guided version, the AJ.168 by Martel, is used only by the UK. (MARTeL Missile, Anti-Radiation. Television)
The missile usually travels at high sub-sonic speeds but can break the sound-barrier in steep dives. Its two-stage solid rocket motor produces a 2.4 s boost and 22.2 s of sustained thrust.
                
Operational history
                
The Martel was used by France against Libya during the Epervier military operation, supporting Chad. On January 7, 1987 four French Jaguars took off carrying one Martel each. Three did not launch their missiles, for they were programmed to aim at specific radar wavelengths, but the last one hit an SA-6 radar, destroying it completely.
On March 7, following an air raid by Libyan MiG-21s and MiG-23s, another strike was mounted by ten Martel-equipped Jaguars from EC 4/11 (or more likely EC 3/3 &quot;Ardennes&quot; as that unit was the Martel specialist) against the radar installations at Ouadi Doum air base.

The Air-Sol Moyenne Porte (ASMP; medium-range air to surface missile) is a French nuclear air-launched cruise missile. In French nuclear doctrine it is called a &quot;pre-strategic&quot; weapon, the last-resort &quot;warning shot&quot; prior to a full-scale employment of strategic nuclear weapons. The missile&apos;s construction was contracted to Arospatiale&apos;s Tactical Missile Division, now part of MBDA. The missile cost $600 million to develop.
                
ASMP entered service in May 1986, replacing the earlier free-fall AN-22 bomb on France&apos;s Dassault Mirage IV aircraft and the AN-52 bomb on Dassault Super tendard. About 84 weapons are stockpiled. Carrier aircraft are the Dassault Mirage 2000N, Rafale and Super tendard. The Mirage IVP carried the ASMP until retired in 1996.
                
ASMPA is 5.38 m long and weighs 860 kg. It is a supersonic standoff missile powered by a liquid fuel ramjet.[citation needed] It flies at Mach 2 to Mach 3, with a range between 80 km and 300 km (ASMP)/ 500 km (ASMPA) depending on flight profile. Warhead was a single 300 kiloton TN 81 for ASMP, and a single 300 kiloton Airborne Nuclear Warhead (TNA) for ASMPA.
                
In 1991, 90 missiles and 80 warheads were reported to have been produced. By 2001, 60 were operational.

The ASTAC pod was designed to be carried under the fuselage of F4 Phantom, Mirage F1 and Mirage 2000 combat aircraft to provide an electronic intelligence (ELINT) and tactical reconnaissance capability, including updating the overall situation and generating the electronic order of battle.
                
Designed to operate in dense electromagnetic environments, the ASTAC pod offers high-precision direction of arrival estimation and uses sophisticated algorithms to determine the location of the signals intercepted. Key parameters of signal sources are measured with high precision in any electromagnetic environment, irrespective of the transmission techniques employed.
                
The ASTAC pod has been deployed on many occasions in different theatres of operations. During Operation Harmattan in Libya, for example, it was carried by French Air Force Mirage F1CRs and once again demonstrated its key contribution to the intelligence gathering capability that was critical to mission success.
                
ASTAC is a B band to K band (NATO) SIGINT aircraft pod made by Thales Group. It is a reconnaissance system used to intercept and analyse tactical and technical data on Radio frequency emissions radiated by land-based radars and weapon systems. Recording capabilities and datalinks for real-time interfaces with ground stations are available as options. In operation under F-4 Phantom, Mirage 2000-5, Mirage F1. It has been fitted under F-16 for NATO trials. The different generations of ASTAC are operated by more than ten air forces worldwide.

The AT-2 was the first Soviet ATGM to be deployed from helicopters. Small numbers were fitted to the Mi-4AV. The missile was deployed on the Mi-8 Hip as well as the Mi-24 and Mi-25 'Hind' series of helicopters. It was also deployed on the BRDM-1 and BRDM-2 infantry fighting vehicles.
                
The original AT-2A (3M11 Falanga) missile was problematic; one Russian source describes the missile as &quot;notable for its complexity and low reliability&quot;. Also, the missile's range was felt to be inadequate. An improved version of the missile was developed: the AT-2B (9M17 Skorpion). Externally, the missiles are very similar, however the AT-2B range is increased to 3.5 km. The standard production version was the 9M17M Skorpion-M, which entered service in 1968.
                
The next development was to integrate SACLOS guidance, resulting in the AT-2 Swatter-C or 9M17P Skorpion-P. It entered service in 1969. A product improved version the 9M17MP was developed that had an improved engine and signal lamp.
                
The missile has been used extensively in the following wars on the Mi-24 platform.

The 9M14 Malyutka (Russian:&quot;Little one&quot;, NATO reporting name: AT-3 Sagger) is a manual command to line of sight (MCLOS) wire-guided anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) system developed in the Soviet Union. It was the first man-portable anti-tank guided missile of the Soviet Union and is probably the most widely produced ATGM of all time with Soviet production peaking at 25,000 missiles a year during the 1960s and 1970s. In addition, copies of the missile have been manufactured under various names by at least five countries.
                
Since supplemented by more advanced anti-tank guided missiles, the Sagger and its variants have seen widespread use in nearly every regional conflict since the 1960s.
                
Development began in July 1961 with the government assigning the project to two design teams: Tula and Kolomna. The requirements were:
                
Vehicle mountable and/or man portable
Range of 3,000 meters
Armor penetration of 200 millimetres at 60°
Maximum weight of 10 kilograms
                
The designs were based on the Western ATGMs of the 1950s, such as the French ENTAC and the Swiss Cobra. In the end, the prototype developed by the Kolomna Machine Design Bureau, who were also responsible for the AT-1 Snapper, was chosen. Initial tests were completed by 20 December 1962, and the missile was accepted for service on 16 September 1963.
                
The missile can be fired from a portable suitcase launcher (9P111), ground vehicles (BMP-1, BRDM-2) and helicopters (Mi-2, Mi-8, Mi-24, Soko Gazelle). The missile takes about five minutes to deploy from its 9P111 fibreglass suitcase, which also serves as the launching platform.
                
The missile is guided to the target by means of a small joystick (9S415), which requires intensive training of the operator. The operator&apos;s adjustments are transmitted to the missile via a thin three-strand wire that trails behind the missile. The missile climbs into the air immediately after launch, which prevents it from hitting obstacles or the ground. In flight, the missile spins at 8.5 revolutions per second it is initially spun by its booster, and the spin is maintained by the slight angle of the wings. The missile uses a small gyroscope to orient itself relative to the ground; as a result, the missile can take some time to bring back in line with the target, which gives it a minimum range of between 500 and 800 m. For targets under 1,000 m, the operator can guide the missile by eye; for targets beyond this range the operator uses the 8x power, 22.5 degree field of view 9Sh16 periscope sight.
                
The engagement envelope is a 3 km, 45 degree arc centered on the missile&apos;s launch axis. At ranges under 1.5 km, this arc reduces until, at the 500 m range, the missile can only hit targets 50 m either side of the center line. Accuracy falls off away from the launch axis falling to approximately half its optimal accuracy at the extremes.
                
While early estimates of the missile hitting the target ranged from 60 to 90%, experience has shown that it can drop to an efficiency between 2 and 25% in case of less than optimal conditions and lack of skill from the operator. In fact, MCLOS requires considerable skill on the part of the operator: according to some sources, it takes 2,300 simulated firings to become proficient with the missile as well as 50 to 60 simulated firings a week to maintain the skill level.[citation needed] Nevertheless, the weapon has always been quite popular with its operators and has enjoyed a constant updating effort both in the Soviet Union/Russia and in other countries.
                
The two most serious defects of the original weapon system are its minimum range of between 500 and 800 m (targets that are closer cannot be effectively engaged) and the amount of time it takes the slow moving missile to reach maximum range around 30 seconds giving the intended target time to take appropriate action, either by retreating behind an obstacle, laying down a smoke-screen, or by returning fire on the operator.
                
Later versions of the missile addressed these problems by implementing the much easier to use SACLOS guidance system (though only available for ground vehicle and helicopter mounts), as well as upgrading the propulsion system to increase the average flight speed. The latest updates sport tandem warheads or probes in order to counteract explosive reactive armor, as well as thermal imaging systems. Even in these latest version, the Malyutka is probably the most inexpensive ATGM in service, with unitary price caps in the order of hundreds of dollars instead of the tens of thousands of the latest third generation models.

The 9K111 Fagot (Russian: &quot;bassoon&quot;) is a second-generation tube-launched SACLOS wire-guided anti-tank missile system of the Soviet Union for use from ground or vehicle mounts. The 9K111 Fagot missile system was developed by the Tula KBP Design Bureau for Instrument Building. &quot;9M111&quot; is the GRAU designation of the missile.
                
The 9K111 Fagot was developed by the Tula Machinery Design Bureau (Tula KBP) and development began in 1962 with the aim of producing the next generation of SACLOS ATGMs for use in both the man portable role and the tank destroyer role. The 9K111 Fagot was developed alongside the 9M113 Konkurs; both missiles use similar technology, only differing in size, and can use the same launchers. The missile entered service in 1970.
                
The missile is stored and carried in a container/launch tube. It is fired from a 9P135 launcher post, a simple tripod. A 9S451 guidance box is fitted to the tripod with the missile sitting just above. The 9Sh119 sight is fitted to the left side (from the gunner&apos;s POV). The complete launcher system weighs 22.5 kg (50 lb). The gunner lays prone while firing. The system can engage moving targets travelling at less than 60 km/h (37 mph). The launcher post can traverse through 360 degrees horizontally, and +/- 20 degrees in elevation. The sight has a magnification of 10x and a 5 degree field of view. Up to three missiles a minute can be fired from a launcher post.
                
The system uses a gas generator to push the missile out of the launch tube, which exits from the rear of the launch tube in a manner similar to a recoilless rifle. The missile leaves the launch tube at 80 m/s (180 mph; 290 km/h), and is then quickly accelerated to 186 m/s (420 mph; 670 km/h) by its solid fuel motor. This initial high speed reduces the missile&apos;s deadzone, since it can be launched directly at the target, rather than in an upward arc.
                
The launcher tracks the position of an incandescent infrared bulb on the back of the missile relative to the target and transmits appropriate commands to the missile via a thin wire that trails behind the missile. The SACLOS guidance system has many benefits over MCLOS, with the accuracy of the system stated as 90% in some sources, though its performance is probably comparable to the TOW or the later SACLOS versions of the 9K11 Malyutka.

9K114 Shturm (Russian: &quot;shturm&quot; means storm (assault) in German) is a SACLOS radio guided anti-tank missile system of the Soviet Union. Its GRAU designation is 9K114. Its NATO reporting name is AT-6 Spiral. The missile itself is known as the 9M114 Kokon (Cocoon).
                
The missile called 9M114 Kokon (Cocoon) was developed by the Kolomna Machine Design Bureau, which was also responsible for the 3M6 Shmel and 9M14 Malyutka. Work on the missile began in 1967, with the hope of using the missile on Mi-24s. However, delays forced the design of an upgraded Falanga system (9M17 Skorpion) using SACLOS guidance as a stopgap. Testing of the missile was completed in 1974, and it was accepted into service in 1976. The missile has no direct western counterpart, though, in role, it is closest to the AGM-114 Hellfire, and in guidance method, to the MGM-18 Lacrosse.
                
It was originally given the NATO designation AS-8, before being redesignated as AT-6.
                
The missile can be deployed on a variety of platforms, including the Mi-24V and from 1979-onwards the MT-LB based 9P149 tank destroyer. There is also a shipborne version of the missile, with the launcher holding six missiles.
                
The missile is transported and launched from a glass-reinforced plastic tube. The missile uses a Soyuz NPO solid-rocket sustainer, with a small booster stage to launch the missile from its tube.
                
The missile is SACLOS with a radio command link. The use of a radio link allows the missile to travel much faster and further than if it were wire guided. The radio link is a VHF system with five frequency bands and two codes to minimize the risk of jamming. The system comprises a KPS-53AV 8× daylight-only direct vision sight with an integrated laser rangefinder. After the missile is launched, the gunner has to keep the sight&apos;s crosshairs on the target until impact. Appropriate steering commands are transmitted to the missile via the radio link.
                
The missile flies above the gunner&apos;s line of sight to the target. With the range of the target determined by the laser rangefinder, the missile descends onto the target just before impact. This is done primarily to clear obstacles, instead of achieving a top-attack, and can be switched off. It is possible to engage low and slow moving helicopters with the system; however, since the missile only has a contact fuze, a direct hit would be needed.
                
Soviet sources report kill ratios of 75 to 85% during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Also a Mil demonstration in Sweden in late 1995 using a Mi-28A firing Shturm and Ataka missiles also showed good results: from a hovering helicopter, a Shturm was fired at a target 900 m away; and from level flight at 200 km/h an Ataka was fired at a target 4,700 m away. Both missiles passed within 1 m of their aiming point.
                
It is possible there were problems with early models of the missile; Soviet stocks of the missile were rebuilt to AT-6B and C standard by 1994.
                
30 June 2014 adopted by the Russian army modernized self-propelled antitank missile system 9M114 Shturm-S into 9K132 Shturm-SM having a sight with television and thermal channels as well as a new missile with a high-explosive fragmentation warhead and a proximity fuse.
                
The export price of the missile in 1992 was $50,000.

The latest aircraft antiarmor missile is the 9A4172 of the Vikhr (AT-9) family for Ka-50 helicopters and Su-25T aircraft. It was built in Tula by A. Shipunov&apos;s group (Priborostroyeniye Design Bureau), builder of aircraft guns. The missile is fired from launchers containing a 6-8 pack. Its guidance system combines radio-command guidance during the initial flight stage followed by laser-beam guidance afterwards. The missile is a supersonic one with a 8-10 km range, its caliber is 125 mm, and its weight together with the launcher is 60 kg. The two-stage shaped-charge warhead is capable of piercing armor of equivalent to 900 mm thickness. With the switch set in the appropriate position on the pilot&apos;s panel in the cockpit, the Vikhr operates as an air-to-air missile with a radar turn-on for approach navigation. 
                
It is effective against airborne targets flying at speeds up to 800 km/h (600 km/h during rendezvous tacks). Also available is an IC-35 flying target simulator for training a ship&apos;s air defense team in destroying missiles of this class. The &quot;Zvezda&quot; product line includes a variant of the Kh-35 missile which operates with thermal-imaging rather than radar guidance during the final flight stage.

The Ataka missile is stored in a glass reinforced plastic tube, which also acts as its launcher. The missile is reported to be considerably faster than the 9K114 Shturm, with longer range than the original version. It still uses radio command guidance, but the system has been improved when compared to the earlier 9K114 Shturm.
                
The system is carried by the multiple kinds of helicopters including the Mi-28 and Mi-35. It is also offered for ground vehicles like the BMPT and the 9P149.
                
There are three main missiles that are compatible with the launch system. The first is a two-stage anti-armour weapon that features a tandem warhead for dealing with add-on armor. The second variant of the missile  designated as 9M120F  has a thermobaric warhead for use against infantry positions and bunkers. The third variant of the 9M120 Ataka is the 9M220, which features a proximity fused expanding rod warhead, providing the missile with air-to-air capability against low- and slow-flying aircraft.

The 9M117 Bastion is a Russian laser beam-riding anti-tank missile. It is used in a number of separate weapon systems, including the 9K116-1 Bastion missile system (AT-10 Stabber), 9K118 Sheksna (AT-12 Swinger), T-12 antitank gun and the 3UBK12 fired from the BMP-3. The 100 mm projectile entered service in 1981.
                
The 9K112 Kobra (AT-8 Songster) was the first Soviet tube fired anti-tank missile to enter service; however, it was only deployed in limited numbers to front line units. Development work began in the late 1970s on a third generation of guided projectiles that would use laser guidance rather than radio command links. The guidance system was developed by Igor Aristarkhov, and the missile was developed by Petr Komonov. The Bastion was developed firstly as a relatively cheap missile fired from towed MT-12 100 mm smoothbore AT-guns. The 9M117 missile was part of the 3UBK10 round and the whole weapon system was designated 9K116 Kastet. A laser guidance device was seated on a tripod next to the gun. The system was commissioned in 1981.
                
During development of the 9K116 system, it was recognized that it could enhance the long range firepower of the older T-55 and T-62 tanks. The system for the T-55&apos;s D-10T 100 mm rifled gun was designated 9K116-1 Bastion (3UBK10-1 round); and for the T-62&apos;s U-5TS 115 mm smoothbore gun, 9K116-2 Sheksna (3UBK10-2 round). The 9M117 missiles were identical, as in the towed version; however, the 115 mm version had additional guiding rings. They were commissioned in 1983. Then, the 9K116-3 system was developed for the 100 mm rifled gun of the BMP-3 infantry fighting vehicle, commissioned in 1987. Similar systems, with larger caliber 9M119 Svir missiles, were developed for the 125 mm guns of the T-72 and T-80 tanks.
                
The 100 mm round resembles a normal 100 mm anti-tank round, and is loaded and fired in the same fashion. The round uses a reduced explosive charge to launch the projectile out of the barrel of the gun at around 400 to 500 m/s. After leaving the gun barrel, a small cover falls away from the window on the rear of the missile. The rocket motor ignites 1.5 seconds after firing the missile, and it burns for 6 seconds.
                
The projectiles use beam-riding laser guidance. A cone of laser light divided into sectors is projected from the launching tank/vehicle/gun, each sector having a different frequency or modulation. The missile has a small window in the rear with a laser sensor to detect the modulation of the light. Using this modulation, the missile steers itself, maintaining its position in the cone. Laser beam is zoomed during the missile flight so it has the same diameter (about 6 meters) throughout the missile flightpath. The laser beam-riding guidance system is smaller than a radio command one, and cheaper and simpler than semi-active laser guidance. The missile is also not prone to radio or optical jamming. On the other hand, a target has to be tracked by laser sight all the time, and the system can not be reliably used on the move.
                
The missile&apos;s flight time to 4,000 meters is approximately 12 seconds. After 26 to 41 seconds, the missile self-destructs.

The Thomson-CSF ATLIS II (Automatic Tracking and Laser Integration System) is a French laser/electro-optical targeting pod for fighter bomber and attack aircraft.
                
ATLIS was developed starting in 1976, entering service in 1980. It was developed for the French Armée de l'Air, initially carried by SEPECAT Jaguar and Mirage 2000 aircraft.
                
ATLIS incorporates a laser designator boresighted with a television camera. The pilot or weapon systems officer uses the crosshairs to mark a target, which can then be attacked with laser-guided bombs or other guided weapons from the designating aircraft or other, friendly forces. Because it is designed for use by single-seat aircraft, it has a novel automatic lock-on feature, which keeps the laser focused on the target without further operator intervention (using an inertial guidance system, it can generally keep the laser on target even if the beam is temporarily interrupted by clouds).
                
ATLIS II is used by the SEPECAT Jaguar, Mirage F1, Mirage 2000, Mirage 2000N, and some Pakistani F-16s. It is compatible with various U.S. and French laser-guided bombs, with the French Aerospatiale AS-30L missile, and even with some Russian bombs and guided weapons.
                
In 1985, Pakistan Air Force selected ATLIS-II for its F-16 aircraft, making it the first non-European operator of this system. ATLIS-II pod is carried on the 5L intake station on the F-16. Over the years precision targeting using ATLIS has been a distinct phenomenon over-viewed regularly in PAF s operational exercises. In the recent PAF operations in Global War on Terrorism, ATLIS-II was extensively used for precision targeting.
                
The pod is limited in being primarily a daylight/clear-weather system, and is being slowly replaced by the more capable Thomson-CSF PDLCT ("Pod de Designation Laser a Camera Thermique&quot; / Laser Designation Pod with Infrared Camera&quot;) and Thales Damocles, which has a FLIR.

The AV-8B Harrier is a Vertical/Short Take Off and Landing (VSTOL) attack aircraft. The Harrier can operate from rough air fields, small carriers or even a small patch of concrete. This ability makes the Harrier ideal for expeditionary forces, such as the U.S. Marines, who normally operate in the forward area of the battle.
The Harrier uses a single engine with four rotating exhaust ports. To achieve a vertical takeoff, the ports rotate downward, and they are capable of holding the aircraft in a hover indefinitely. The front ports are positioned ahead of the wings and take air from the engine&apos;s compressor section. The rear ports are at the middle of the wing and vent exhaust gases. The ports rotate to provide both lift and thrust. It is often suggested that the vectored thrusters give the Harrier a maneuvering advantage over fixed-nozzle aircraft. The Harrier was designed as an attack aircraft, however, and gives up more in agility to purpose-built fighters than it gains through &quot;VIFFing&quot; (Vectoring In Forward Flight), although if a knife fight is dragged low and slow, the Harrier may have an edge on many fighters. One distinct disadvantage to the Harrier&apos;s design is the placement of the exhaust ports near the center of the aircraft. Combat experience has shown that the Harrier is more likely to suffer catastrophic damage from an infrared missile hit than a conventional jet like the F-18, where the exhaust is located at the rear of the aircraft away from other essential systems.
                
The British Navy used the Harrier during the Falkland Islands dispute with Argentina. The aircraft performed well and enjoyed a favorable rate of exchange with Argentinean A-4 Skyhawks.
During the Gulf War, AV-8B squadrons were the most forward-based tactical strike aircraft, operating only 40 miles from the Kuwaiti border. Harrier pilots flew 3,567 sorties and delivered almost 3,000 tons of ordnance. Four AV-8Bs were shot down.

The B-1B is a long-range strategic bomber that filled the capability gap between the B-52 and the B-2 during the decade of the eighties. When the cold war ended, the B-1B&apos;s low-level nuclear strike mission also did. Converting the aircraft to a conventional bombing role has been more difficult than expected so the aircraft wasn&apos;t used in the Gulf War. Just programming the bomb delivery system and loading the conventional weapons dispensers can take hours to complete. Just fewer than 100 B-1Bs were procured. Two aircraft have been lost in accidents.
                
In the early 1990s, following the Gulf War and concurrent with the disestablishment of SAC and its reassignment to the newly formed Air Combat Command, the B-1B was converted to conventional bombing use. It first served in combat during Operation Desert Fox in 1998 and again during the NATO action in Kosovo the following year. The B-1B has supported U.S. and NATO military forces in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Air Force had 66 B-1Bs in service as of September 2012. The B-1B is expected to continue to serve into the 2030s, with the Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider to begin replacing the B-1B after 2025. The B-1s in inventory are planned to be retired by 2036.

Along with the B-52 and B-1B, the B-2 provides the penetrating flexibility and effectiveness inherent in manned bombers. Its low-observable, or &quot;stealth&quot;, characteristics give it the unique ability to penetrate an enemy&apos;s most sophisticated defenses and threaten its most valued, and heavily defended, targets. Its capability of penetrating air defenses and threaten effective retaliation provides an effective deterrent and combat force well into the 21st century.
The blending of low-observable technologies with high aerodynamic efficiency and large payload gives the B-2 important advantages over existing bombers. Its low observability grants it greater freedom of action at high altitudes, thus increasing its range and providing a better field of view for the aircraft&apos;s sensors. Its unrefueled range is approximately 6,000 nautical miles (9,600 kilometers).
                
The B-2 development program was initiated in 1981, and the Air Force was granted approval in 1987 to begin procurement of 132 operational B-2 aircraft, principally for strategic bombing missions. With the demise of the Soviet Union, the emphasis of B-2 development was changed to conventional operations and the number was reduced to 20 operational aircraft, plus 1 test aircraft that was not planned to be upgraded to an operational configuration. Production of these aircraft has been concurrent with development and testing.
                
The first B-2 was publicly displayed on November 22, 1988, when it was rolled out of its hangar at Air Force Plant 42, Palmdale, California. Its first flight was on July 17, 1989. The B-2 Combined Test Force, Air Force Flight Test Center, Edwards Air Force Base, California, is responsible for flight testing the engineering and the manufacturing of the aircraft as they are produced. Three of the six developmental aircraft delivered to Edwards are continuing flight testing.

The B-52G (Model 464-253) was the most numerous sub-type of the Stratofortress series, a total of 193 being built between October 1958 and February 1961. It was the first Stratofortess version to be built exclusively at the Wichita factory.
In the design of the B-52G, considerable attention was paid to reducing the structural weight. Different materials were used in the construction of the airframe, and the wing structure was extensively redesigned. The most visible difference was a vertical tail reduced in size. The height was trimmed down from 48 feet 3 inches to 40 feet 7 inches. The new tail was tested on the first B-52A (52-001) and perhaps also on either the XB-52 or YB-52 before being adopted as standard for the B-52G.
The B-52G retained the J57-P-43W engines of the B-52F, but the engine&apos;s water injection system was improved in duration capability by adding a 1200-gallon tank of water in the forward fuselage.
                
In the B-52G, the gunner was moved from the extreme rear of the aircraft to a position beside the electronic warfare officer in the forward part of the fuselage.
The B-52G featured a &quot;wet&quot; wing which resulted in it being able to carry 48,030 gallons of fuel as opposed to the 41,553 gallons of the B-52F. Each wing had three integral fuel tanks which replaced the rubber bladder-type tanks in the wings of previous versions.
The familiar jettisonable 3000-gallon underwing auxiliary fuel tanks of earlier versions were replaced by smaller, fixed 700-gallon tanks. These were actually fitted not so much for the additional fuel capacity but more for their role as bob weights to help prevent wing flutter.
                
The B-52G flew for the first time on August 31, 1958. The B-52G entered service with the 5th Bomb Wing at Travis AFB on February 13, 1959. During April 1972, a contingent of B-52Gs was sent to Southeast Asia to support the bombing campaign against North Vietnam. It turned out that the B-52G was not nearly as suitable for conventional warfare as was the &apos;D, since the &apos;G was unable to carry bombs externally and it did not have the &apos;Big Belly&apos; modifications that gave the B-52D such a fearsome conventional capability. The lighter structure of the B-52G, resulting in outstanding long-range performance, had the undesired side-effect of making the aircraft more vulnerable to battle damage. Only one B-52G was able to survive the experience of being hit and damaged by a SAM, whereas several B-52Ds hit by SAMs were able to land safely. The B-52D actually had better electronic countermeasures capabilities than the B-52G, and the tail gunner in the rear of the &apos;D actually turned out to be quite useful in monitoring SAM launches. In the later stages of Linebacker II, some of the B-52Gs were actually diverted in-flight to targets deemed to be less dangerous.
Retirement of the B-52G began in the late 1980s. The Gulf War of 1990-1991 resulted in a temporary delay in the inactivation of B-52G units. On February 16, 1991, seven B-52Gs armed with 39 AGM-86C conventionally armed cruise missiles took off from Barksdale AFB bound for Iraq. After a couple of refuelings, they arrived over the southern border of Iraq, where they launched 35 of their ALCMs against targets in central and southern Iraq. The targets included a power station, a telephone exchange, and other electrical generating facilities. The missiles were timed so that they would all reach their separate targets nearly simultaneously. In spite of the Gulf War, the disposal of B-52Gs continued unabated. The last B-52G went to storage at the Davis-Monthan AFB in spring 1994. A few were passed along to museum collections in the United States.
Throughout its life the B-52G saw several implementations of new offensive weapons systems.
In 1959, the AGM-28 Hound Dog was deployed aboard the B-52Gs, and remained in service until June 1975. The Hound Dog was a turbojet powered nuclear-tipped cruise missile. Around this same time the AGM-20 Quail was deployed, which was a turbojet powered decoy, which mimicked the radar cross-section of a B-52. The Quail was withdrawn from service in 1989.
In 1970, the nuclear tipped AGM-69 SRAM was added to the B-52G inventory, initially 20 could be carried (12 externally and 8 internally). External carriage was abandoned in the 1980s and the weapon was removed from the operational inventory in 1990 due to concerns of warhead safety.
In the early 1980s, the B-52Gs were modified to carry the AGM-86B ALCM. The AGM-86C entered service in the B-52G fleet in the late 1980s, but its existence was kept secret until 1992, when it was revealed that 35 of these weapons had been used against targets in Iraq during the Gulf War. Its classified codename was Senior Surprise. Most of the AGM-86Cs were expended during the Gulf War, but more were modified later. This time period also saw the addition of the AGM-84 Harpoon to the B-52G inventory, and some 30 B-52Gs were modified for the maritime role. Towards the end of the operational career of the B-52G, the AGM-142A Raptor, which has been in production since 1989, was added as well.

		<DescriptionData>
The B-52 was designed at the height of the Cold War with the sole purpose of carrying nuclear devices into the heart of the Soviet Union. Since its entry into service in late 1957, the Stratofortress has, with minor modifications, proven itself to be a versatile strategic weapon. The B-52G can fly high above a target and accurately deliver a staggering payload of bombs, or it can strike from afar with huge missiles. Though aging, the enormous B-52G is still a deadly threat to America&apos;s foes. Once the skies are cleared, a single wing of these behemoths can destroy large numbers of hardened ground targets in a matter of minutes. The B-52 contains four 12.7 mm machine guns in a radar-controlled tail turret, and can either carry up to 50,000 lbs of conventional or nuclear bombs, 12 cruise missiles or 20 SRAM missiles.
With the room to carry extensive electronic countermeasures equipment, the B-52 isn&apos;t as vulnerable to SAM systems as might be thought. During the Gulf War, B-52s delivered 30% of the total bomb tonnage dropped by the Coalition. In the first few days of the war, the bombers overflew their targets at 200 ft AGL. Later in the war, the mission profile changed to 30-40 thousand feet. No B52s were lost.

The B53 was designed to be carried internally by the B-52. It was to be replaced by the B83 but retirement was delayed until 1987, probably due to a wish to retain a high yield weapon capable of destroying very hard underground targets.
340 of these early nuclear weapons were produced and they does not feature the safety and security features of the B61 and B83 bombs. The fusing must be accomplished on the ground by the maintenance personnel.

This is the most recent U.S. nuclear bomb design and probably the last. It is a megaton class weapon capable of laydown surface delivery against hardened targets. It is the first megaton class weapon with such capability.
To be able to survive a high-speed, low-level drop its nose cone is capable of withstanding impact with concrete or steele. The detonation may be delayed up to 120 seconds to allow the aircraft to escape the blast.
Originally intended for delivery by the B-1B Lancer the B83 can survive delivery at speeds up to Mach 2 at an altitude of 150ft. Now it will likely be carried by the B-2 Spirit.

The BAP-100 (French:Bombe Anti-Piste 100 mm, Anti-Runway Bomb) is a French anti-runway cluster bomb developed in the mid-1970s, and which entered service with the French Air Force in the early 1980s.
The bomb consists of eighteen submunitions, arranged in a cluster. Accelerated by an internal propulsion system, the munitions are designed to ensure total runway destruction in a single pass by aircraft. Forty of the munitions were used by the French Air Force during the Ouadi Doum airstrike in 1986.

The Bar Lock is a general purpose aerial surveillance radar used for early warning, Ground Controlled Intercept (GCI) and target acquisition for SAM systems. The system is normally trailer-mounted so that it can be moved around the battlefield to enhance survivability.
                
The P-30 was developed by the All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Radio Engineering (VNIIRT)[3] as an early warning ground control and interception radar for the Soviet Air Defence Forces, airforce, and navy of the Soviet Union. Saturn was a development of an earlier radar design, the P-30 radar with which it shares many similarities. By 1958 the radar had completed state trials and was accepted into service, offering improved detection range and reliability than the previous P-30.
                
In 1961 an improved variant of the P-35 was developed, the P-35M,[4] which featured an improved antenna layout. By 1971 a new variant of the P-35 had entered service, &quot;sword-35&quot;. The sword-35 upgrade featured faster scanning and an improved antenna layout and polarization filters to help eliminate passive interference and improve detection of targets flying below 300 meters. Sword-35 also incorporated a limited capability to modulate pulse duration and frequency to counter active jamming. The P-35 has now been succeeded by its successor, the P-37 radar.

Thales, with support from the Direction gnrale de l&apos;armement (DGA) the French government defence procurement and technology agency is progressing the development of a new 120 mm laser-guided, unpowered, air-to-surface munition evolved from the legacy Thomson Brandt Armements 120 mm Bombe d&apos;Appui Tactique (BAT-120) tactical support bomb. Model of the developmental BAT-120LG laser-guided munition shown at the 2017 Paris Air Show.
                
Weighing 35 kg, with a 10 kg high-explosive warhead, BAT-120LG retains the airframe of the legacy BAT-120, but introduces the laser-guidance sub-assembly of the Thales Aculeus LG 68 mm laser-guided induction rocket, which is currently being qualified with the French Ministry of Defence (MoD), and its evolution for the laser guidance solution of the developmental Thales 120 mm guided mortar round (Munition Guide de Mortier (MGM), currently under technical evaluation by the MoD, to create a 120 mm laser-guidance front-end assembly.
                
The semi-active laser seeker, inertial measurement unit, battery, electronic controller unit, and a modified software package are all derived from the Aculeus LG, while the control actuator system is adapted from the MGM round. Both the forward canard array and the aft swept-back fold-out cruciform fin assembly have been re-designed for improved aerodynamics.

The Belknap class cruiser was a class of single-ended guided missile cruisers (their missile armament was installed only forward, unlike &quot;double-ended&quot; missile cruisers with missile armament installed both forward and aft) built for the United States Navy during the 1960s. They were originally designated as DLG frigates (destroyer leaders; the USN use of the term frigate from 1950 to 1975 was intended to evoke the power of the sailing frigates of old), but in the 1975 fleet realignment, they were reclassified as guided missile cruisers (CG).
                
When commissioned, the main armament of the Belknap class was a 5-inch/54-caliber Mk. 42 gun on the quarterdeck and a twin-rail RIM-2 Terrier Mk 10 Missile Launcher on the foredeck. The Mk 10 Mod 7 launchers in this class were also capable of launching RUR-5 ASROC to eliminate need for a separate Mk 112 ASROC launcher. These were unofficially spoken of as Ter/AS (tear-ass) launchers. The class was also equipped with two twin 3&quot;/50 caliber guns for defence against sub-sonic aircraft. In the early 1980s, the Terrier missiles were replaced with RIM-67 Standard missiles; and during the NTU program in the late 1980s and early 1990s the class had its Standard SM-1 system upgraded to utilize SM-2ER Block II, the 3 inch guns were replaced with two 4 cell Harpoon Surface-to-surface missile launchers, and two Phalanx CIWS systems were installed.
                
The derivative USS Truxtun shared the weapons systems outfit of the Belknap class, but was nuclear-powered, larger and substantially unrelated in design (for example, many weapons systems in different locations, such as the aft-facing GMLS). Most information related to nuclear cruisers is still classified, but Truxtun appears to be more a Belknap-like derivative of the nuclear cruiser Bainbridge than the other way around.

Russian BetAB class (concrete-piercing bomb). Low drag Free-fall Anti Runway &quot;dumb&quot; bomb (like BLU-107). It utilizes a parachute drogue and solid - propellant booster.
The BETAB-500 or the BETAB-500 Concrete-Piercing Bomb is a Soviet and Russian 500-kilogram (1,100 lb) bomb designed to penetrate and destroy reinforced concrete structures and to damage runways. During the Syrian civil war, the Russian military has used it repeatedly. In 2016, apparently the first use of this bomb in an urban environment occurred in the Eastern part of the city of Aleppo.

The LGB system consists of two major bolt-on subassemblies for the conversion of conventional free-fall bombs to a laser-guided bomb. All of the bombs will have the standard NATO 356 mm suspension lug spacing. The bolt-on front end guidance section is a streamlined container with four moving control clipped-tip delta fins and a long moving probe that acts like a wind vane. On the front end of the probe is a canister with a glass dome nose. The canister has two small swept rectangular wings fitted to it at mid-body. The bolt-on rear end assembly has four large, semi-folded, flip-out aerofoil surfaces arranged in a cruciform pattern. The nose guidance kit fitted to the 250 and 400 kg bombs weighs 45 kg and the tail wings weigh 80 kg. The units fitted to the 1,000 kg bomb weigh 60 and 110 kg respectively. When the system is fitted to the 250 kg GP bomb, the weapon will be 3.61 m long, have a maximum body diameter of 324 mm and a weight of 250 kg. The 400 kg GP LGB is 3.54 m long, has a body diameter of 403 mm and weighs 470 kg. The 400 kg PE LGB under development will be 3.64 m long, have a diameter of 391 mm and weigh 450 kg. The closed tailspan of these three bombs is 0.79 m, and this extends to 1.43 m once the bomb has cleared the release aircraft

Matra, now Matra BAe Dynamics, commenced development of a Laser-Guided Bomb (LGB) similar in principle to the US Paveway munitions in which laser seeking guidance packages are fitted as modifications kits to conventional free-fall bombs, to provide accuracy against laser marked targets. The laser guidance subsystem was derived from the Ariel seeker developed for the AS 30 laser-guided air-tosurface missile. The use of this seeker, produced by Thomson Both the 400 kg GP and 1,000 kg LGBs are in full production. The 400 kg version entered operational service with the French Air Force in 1985 and the 1,000 kg Arcole around 1992. The 400 kg LGB was used during the Gulf conflict in 1991 and the 1,000 kg Arcole was used in Bosnia in 1994. Some five hundred 400 kg and one hundred 1,000 kg LGBs have been ordered by the French Air Force. Both types of LGB have been ordered by a number of foreign customers including some 1,000 kg LGBs for the UK. In 1995, it was reported that Matra BAe Dynamics has received orders for over 1,000 Arcole 1,000 kg LGBs. The 250 kg bomb and the 400 kg PE bomb are reported to have completed development and to have entered production in 1995.

The BGM-71 TOW (&quot;Tube-launched, Optically tracked, Wire-guided&quot;) is an American anti-tank missile. TOW replaced much smaller missiles like the SS.10 and ENTAC, offering roughly twice the effective range, a more powerful warhead, and a greatly improved semi-automatic guidance system that could also be equipped with infrared cameras for night time use.
                
First produced in 1970, TOW is one of the most widely used anti-tank guided missiles. It can be found in a wide variety of manually carried and vehicle-mounted forms, as well as widespread use on helicopters. Originally designed by Hughes Aircraft in the 1960s, the weapon is currently produced by Raytheon.
                
The TOW is a heavy tripod-based anti-tank infantry missile that can also be equipped on armored vehicles and aircraft. This weapon is designed to make big holes in tanks and has a maximum penetration of more than 2.5 feet of armor plating. In addition, the missiles fired by the launchers have been upgraded several times, making these weapons effective even against reactive tank armor.

The Tomahawk  Land Attack Missile (TLAM) is a long-range, all-weather, jet-powered, subsonic cruise missile that is primarily used by the United States Navy and Royal Navy in ship- and submarine-based land-attack operations.
                
It was designed and initially produced in the 1970s by General Dynamics as a medium- to long-range, low-altitude missile that could be launched from a surface platform. The missile's modular design accommodates a wide variety of warhead, guidance, and range capabilities. At least six variants and multiple upgraded versions have been introduced since then, including air-, sub-, and ground-launched variants and conventional and nuclear-armed ones. As of 2019, only non-nuclear, sea-launched variants assembled by Raytheon are currently in service.
                
The U.S. Navy launched the BGM-109 Tomahawk project, hiring James H. Walker and a team of scientists at the Applied Physics Laboratory near Laurel, Maryland. Since then, it has been upgraded several times with guidance systems for precision navigation. In 19921994, McDonnell Douglas Corporation was the sole supplier of Tomahawk Missiles and produced Block II and Block III Tomahawk missiles and remanufactured many Tomahawks to Block III specifications. In 1994, Hughes outbid McDonnell Douglas Aerospace to become the sole supplier of Tomahawk missiles. It is now manufactured by Raytheon. In 2016, the U.S. Department of Defense purchased 149 Tomahawk Block IV missiles for $202.3 million.
                
The Tomahawk was most recently used by the U.S. Navy against Syrian chemical weapons facilities when 66 were launched in the 2018 missile strikes against Syria

The 64N6E Big Bird is the key to much of the improved engagement capability, and ballistic missile intercept capability in the later S-300P variants. This system operates in the 2 GHz band and is a phased array with a 30% larger aperture than the US Navy SPY-1 Aegis radar, even accounting for its slightly larger wavelength it amounts to a mobile land based Aegis class package. It has no direct equivalent in the West.
                
Like other components of the S-300PM system, the 64N6E has a number of unique and lateral design features. The radar antenna is mounted on a cabin, in turn mounted on a turntable permitting 360 degree rotation. Unlike Western phased arrays in this class, the 64N6 uses a reflective phased array with a front face horn feed, the horn placed at the end of the long boom which protects the waveguides to the transmitters and receivers in the cabin. The beam steering electronics are embedded inside the antenna array, which has around 2700 phase elements on either face. This Janus faced arrangement permits the Big Bird to concurrently search two 90 degree sectors, in opposite directions, using mechanical rotation to position the antenna and electronic beam steering in azimuth and elevation. This design technique permits incremental growth in output power as the only components of the system which have to handle high microwave power levels are the waveguide and feed horn.
                
The 64N6E is a frequency hopper, and incorporates additional auxiliary antenna/receiver channels for suppression of sidelobe jammers - NIIP claim the ability to measure accurate bearing to jamming sources. The back end processing is Moving Target Indicator (MTI), and like the Aegis the system software can partition the instantaneous sector being covered into smaller zones for specific searches. To enhance MTI performance the system can make use of stored clutter returns from multiple preceding sweeps. Detection ranges for small fighter targets are of the order of 140 to 150 nautical miles for early variants. Per 12 second sweep 200 targets can be detected, and either six or twelve can be individually tracked for engagements.
                
While the Big Bird provides an excellent acquisition capability against aerial and ballistic missile targets, the 5V55 missile was inadequate. The S-300PM/PMU1 introduced the 48N6 which has much better kinematics - cited range against aerial targets is 81 nautical miles, ballistic missile targets 21.5 nautical miles, with a minimum engagement range of 1.6 to 2.7 nautical miles. Low altitude engagement capabilities were improved - down to 20 - 30 ft AGL. The missile speed peaks at 2,100 metres/sec or cca Mach 6. The missiles can be fired at 3 second intervals, and Russian sources claim a single shot kill probability of 80% to 93% for aerial targets, 40% to 85% for cruise missiles and 50% to 77% for TBMs.
                
The latest variant is the 91N6E developed for the S-400 Triumf / SA-21 system. It is known to be a fully digital design with a higher peak power rating than the 64N6E2 to accommodate the longer ranging 48N6E3 and 40N6E missiles.

The BL 755 is a system that was designed to cope with some of the very large area targets that might have been encountered on the Central Front, especially large Warsaw Pact armored formations of Regimental strength (90+ tanks) or more. The weapon can be carried by Tornado GR1, Harrier, Jaguar, Buccaneer and Phantom and consists of a large container which is divided into seven compartments. Each of these compartments contains 21 bomblets making a total of 147 bomblets in all. After the bomb has been released from the aircraft, the 147 bomblets are ejected and fall to the ground, covering a wide area. As each individual bomblet hits a target, a HEAT charge is detonated which can fire a large slug of molten metal through up to 250 mm of armor. In addition, the casing of the bomblet disintegrates and hundreds of fragments of shrapnel are dispersed over a wide area, with resultant damage to personnel and soft- skinned vehicles. The BL 755 can be released at very low altitude and this is essential if pilots are to survive in the highdensity SAM conditions that will apply over the Central Front. Aircraft will only have the chance to make one pass over the target before the defenses are alerted, and for a pilot to make a second pass to ensure accuracy would be suicidal.

The Matra/Thomson BLG 66 Belouga is a French air-launched cluster bomb developed in the 1970s as a replacement for the Giboulee cluster bomb. The Belouga carries 152 66 mm bomblets which are of three types: general purpose fragmentation for use against vehicles, parked aircraft and dumps; HEAT for use against AFVs; interdiction for use against airfields, harbours and marshalling yards. The Belouga is optimized for low-level high-speed strike. Its canister is 3.3 meters (10 feet) long and is 36.6 centimeters (14.5 inches) in diameter. The Belouga is parachute-retarded after release. It is not a clamshell canister, instead ejecting the submunitions from launching chambers circling the weapon. The submunitions deploy small parachutes after ejection. The pilot may select either a concentrated or dispersed submunition scatter pattern before release of the weapon.

		<DescriptionData>
Fire bombs are aluminium tanks filled with an incendiary mixtures or jellied gasoline. A fuse and igniter is installed on each end of the bomb to ignite the filler when the bomb bursts upon impact.
                
The BLU-l/B and BLU-1B/B 750 pound fire bombs are designed for external carriage on high performance aircraft with forced ejection release systems. They are constructed of aluminum with reinforced areas for sway bracing and aircraft forced ejection.
                
Unlike earlier types of fire bombs, the BLU-1/B utilizes electrically-armed impact fuzes which require a cable assembly to utilize power generated by a thermal battery in the initiator. End caps are used in the BLU-1/B instead of nose caps and tail cones and there are
                
significant overall size and weight differences. In addition, the fuze system has an arming delay of .3 to 1.1 seconds.
                
The fire bomb BLU-1B/B differs from the BLU-1/B in that it has a beam assembly (hard back) which is extruded rather than cast, and an initiator adapter which is designed to prevent napalm from leaking into the initiator well. In addition, it has newly designed suspension lugs which allow sufficient clearance for the initiator when the bomb is loaded on an aircraft. Otherwise, the two bombs are identical and are packaged, stored, and assembled in the same manner.

The BLU-10/B and the BLU-10A/B 250 pound antipersonnel and materiel bombs are smaller versions of the BLU-1/B. In addition, they have an initiator adapter which is designed to prevent napalm from leaking into the initiator well. Otherwise, the bombs are similar to the BLU-1/B and are assembled and stored in the same manner. The bomb consists of three major sections: the nose, the center, and the tail, which are nested with the supplemental components to obtain a high density package.
                
The BLU-10A/B bomb has an extended open type hard back. Otherwise it is identical to the BLU-10/B bomb.

The BLU-27 Fire Bomb is a napalm-filled tank designed to break on impact and spread burning fuel on the surrounding area. The bomb is intended for use against dug-in troops, parked aircraft, supply installations, wooden structures, combustible materials and land convoys.
                
The 750 pound fire bomb BLU-27/B is a welded version of fire bomb BLU-1B/B. The bomb is assembled, welded, filled, and packaged at the factory. Therefore, there are no applicable field assembly procedures as in the nested models of other fire bombs.
                
The other principal differences between this bomb and the earlier BLU-1B/B are that the newer model has modified filler caps; the fuze cable is assembled to the bomb at the time of manufacture, and the aft bulkhead is reversed with the flange pointing rearward.

The 500 pound fire bomb BLU-32/B is a welded version of fire bomb BLU-23/B. The bomb is assembled, welded, filled, and packaged at the factory.
                
This bomb differs from the earlier BLU-23/B in that the filler caps have been modified and the fuze cable is assembled to the bomb at time of manufacture. 
                
These 500 lb class stores happen to be finned which allowed for a more accurate and predictable trajectory. If the fins were removed, the canisters would tumble unpredictably after release which created a wider dispersion pattern for the napalm. Napalm was used as an incendiary type weapon.

The BLU-107 Durandal is a specialized runway demolition bomb. A general purpose bomb like the Mk-84 will leave a nice crater in the middle of a runway, but this crater is easily filled in with a bulldozer and patched. In contrast, the Durandal will penetrate underneath the runway surface before it explodes, thus buckling the concrete slabs around the blast area. Not only does the Durandal blast affect a larger area, the damage takes longer to repair since the buckled concrete must be excavated before the hole can be patched.
                
Designed to be dropped from low altitudes, the bomb's fall is slowed by a parachute. The maximum release speed is 550 knots (1,020 km/h; 630 mph) and the minimum release altitude is 200 feet (61 m). When the bomb has reached a 40° angle due to the parachute's drag, it fires a rocket booster that accelerates it into the runway surface. The 100-kilogram (220 lb) primary charge explodes once the weapon has penetrated the concrete and drives the secondary charge even deeper. The 15-kilogram (33 lb) secondary charge then explodes after a one-second delay. Later production weapons have a programmable fuze that can delay the secondary detonation up to several hours.
                
The weapon can penetrate up to 40 centimetres (16 in) of concrete, and creates a crater 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) deep and approximately 5 metres (16 ft) in diameter. In addition, concrete slabs around the crater are disturbed in an area approximately 15 metres (49 ft) in diameter. The disturbed slabs are displaced up to 50 centimetres (20 in) above the original surface, making repair more difficult than the simple crater from a conventional bomb.
                
Engagement Sequence
The BLU-107 is dropped like any other high-drag munition. After release, the Durandal deploys a drag chute to arrest its forward motion. Once the bomb slows and swings down to a vertical attitude, a sensor jettisons the chute and fires a rocket motor. The rocket drives the weapon through the runway surface into the ground. A delayed fuze detonates the warhead. The bomb is designed for a 250-foot level delivery at speeds up to 620 KCAS.
                
Tactics
Most aircraft don&apos;t need an entire runway for takeoff. To put a runway completely out of action, several Durandals must be dropped along the length of the runway. This can be done by rippling singles or pairs of bombs on a fast, low pass. Of course, runways tend to be heavily protected by anti-aircraft weapons, so surprise is highly desirable. (In the Gulf War, British Tornados tasked with this mission suffered the highest loss rate per sortie.)
                
Even after the best attack, a runway can usually be repaired in 4-6 hours, so air bases must be continually retargeted during a campaign to keep them out of operation.

The BM-21 is a Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) capable of firing a volley of 40 122 mm rockets.
                
Operators of the weapon normally compensate for its inaccuracy by firing hundreds of rockets. The advantages of the system are its simplicity, mobility and low cost. In addition, more sophisticated warheads have come into service which further make up for the weapon&apos;s inaccuracy. These new rockets can carry anti-tank/anti-personnel cluster bombs and scatterable mines.

The BM-24 packs a powerful punch against enemy ground units. Generally mounted onto trucks, batteries of these launchers are moved into position to pound the enemy into submission from a distance. While these rockets carry fairly large warheads, their offensive capabilities are definitely limited by their relatively short range and their limited ability to effectively target individual mobile targets. As a result, these weapons must be used in sheer numbers to reliably annihilate their targets.

The BM-30 Smerch is comparable to the US MRLS. It&apos;s role is providing deep strike fire support against armored forces. Among others, Smerch rockets can carry up to five parachute-retarded submunitions. These submunitions carry sensors to identify targets and firing penetrator charges at speeds of 2km/sec.
                
The launcher vehicle cooperates with 9T-234T Transloader and the
1K-123 Vivary Fire Control System. Together with additional equipment, they are referred to as the 9K58.
                
The BM-30 Smerch weapons system is used by at least four countries, among them Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and China.

The BMP-1 was the first ever Infantry Fighting Vehicle to be put into service by any nation. Instead of merely delivering troops to a designated location, it was equipped with firing ports so that the troops inside can fight while the vehicle is on the move. The crew is also provided with night vision scopes, and the vehicle is capable of generating smoke screens. The BMP-1 is fully amphibious.

The BMP-1KSh is a command post and staff armoured vehicle based on the chasiis of the Russian made BMP-1 tracked armoured infantry fighting vehicle. The vehicle was originally designated as BMP M1978. The BMP-1KSh enter in service in the Russian army in 1972, and the serial production began in 1976 at Rubtsovsk engineering plant.The BMP-1KSh is used at the level of motorized rifle regiment.
                
Armament
For its self-protection the BMP-1KSh is armed with a PK 7.62 mm machine gun. The vehicle is always equipped with a one-man turret as the standard BMP-1, but the 76 mm cannon is removed and replaced by a larger telescopic antenna called HAWK EYE.
                
Design and protection
The layout of the BMP-1KSh is very similar to the Russian BMP-1 armoured infantry fighting vehicle. The hull of the BMP-1KSh is made of all-welded steel which provides a protection for the crew against small arms fire and shell splinters. The crew consists of three soldiers, the driver and two radio operators who are sit at the front of the vehicle. There is place at the rear of the crew compartment for four staff officers.
                
Propulsion
The BMP-1KSh is powered by a type UTD-20 6-cylinder in-line water-cooled diesel engine developing 300 hp at 2,000 rpm. The torsion bar suspension is the same as the standard BMP-1, which consists of each side of six rubber-tyred road wheels with the drive sprocket at the front, idler at the rear and three track-return rollers. The first and last road wheel stations have a hydraulic shock-absorber and the top of the track has a light sheet steel cover, which is normally removed when operating in snow.
                
Accessories
The BMP-1KSH is equipped with radio set R-137, R-140M or R-145BM, each with four of five radios. In addition, the vehicle has also telephone equipment, telegraph communication system, ventilation, TNA-3 navigation system and diesel generator which has the capacity to power the communication equipment. The generator is fitted at the top rear of the hull. Small antennas are fitted at the rear side of the crew compartment. The BMP-1KSh is fully amphibious being propelled in the water by its tracks.

The BMP-2 is identical to the BMP-1 in many respects, but there are several important differences. One of the most obvious improvements is the more accurate 30mm cannon mounted on a larger turret. As a result of the increased size of the main gun, the BMP-2 holds one less soldier and moves more slowly than its predecessor (although it does have somewhat improved range). Additionally, the commander is now seated in a position with more visibility.
                
Although the BMP-1 was a revolutionary design, its main armament, the 2A28 Grom and the 9S428 ATGM launcher capable of firing 9M14 Malyutka (NATO: AT-3A Sagger A) and 9M14M Malyutka-M (NATO: AT-3B Sagger B) ATGMs, quickly became obsolete. Therefore, the Soviet Union decided to produce an updated and improved version of the BMP-1. The main emphasis was put on improving the main armament. In 1972, work got under-way to develop an improved version of the BMP-1.
                
During its combat debut in the Yom Kippur War, Egyptian and Syrian BMPs proved vulnerable to .50 calibre machine-gun fire in the sides and rear, and to 106 mm recoilless rifles. The 73 mm gun proved inaccurate beyond 500 metres, and the AT-3 Sagger missile could not be guided effectively from the confines of the turret.
                
Several Soviet technical teams were sent to Syria in the wake of the war to gather information. These lessons, combined with observations of western AFV developments, resulted in a replacement program for the original BMP in 1974. The first product of this program was the BMP-1P upgrade, which was intended as a stopgap to address the most serious problems with the existing design. Smoke grenade launchers were added to the rear of the turret and the manually guided AT-3 Sagger missile system was replaced with the semi-automatically guided AT-4 Spigot / AT-5 Spandrel system. The BMP-1P was in production by the late 1970s and existing BMP-1s were gradually upgraded to the standard during the 1980s.

The BMP-3 is a heavily armed vehicle with firepower equal to both the BMP-1 and BMP-2 combined. As a result, this vehicle is far more capable of covering the troops it deploys in combat.
It is one of the most heavily armed infantry combat vehicles in service, fitted with a low-velocity 2A70 100 mm rifled gun, which can fire conventional shells or 9M117 ATGMs (AT-10 Stabber). 40 100mm-rounds and 8 ATGMs are carried. A 2A72 30 mm dual feed autocannon with 500 (300 HEI and 200 APT) rounds and a rate of fire of 350 to 400 RPM, and a 7.62mm PKT machine gun with 2,000 rounds, all mounted coaxially in the turret. The main gun elevates from -5° to +60°. There are also two 7.62mm PKT bow machine guns, again with 2,000 rounds each. The BMP-3 is capable of engaging targets out to 5,0006,000 meters with its ATGM weapon system 9K116-3 &quot;Basnya&quot;. The minimum engagement distance, flight time and vulnerability of the launcher are typical of command-guided, rather than fire-and-forget, ATGM systems. With conventional ammunition, such as the HE-Frag shell 3OF32, the 2A70 gun has a range of 4,000 meters.
BMP-3 of the UAE with &quot;Namut&quot; thermal sight
                
According to the manufacturer&apos;s web-site, all weapons can be fired from the halt, on the move, and afloat with the same effectiveness. The ability to hit targets on the move with missiles was successfully demonstrated during competitive evaluations in the UAE in 1991.
                
The turret is fitted with the 2K23 system, which consists of an automatic loader with 22 rounds (the remaining 18 rounds are stored in the hull), a 1V539 ballistic computer, a cross-wind sensor, a 2E52-2 stabilising system, a 1D16-3 laser range finder, a 1K13-2 gunner&apos;s sight/guidance device, a PPB-1 gunner&apos;s sight and an OU-5-1 IR searchlight. The commander has a combined optical sight 1PZ-10, a day/night vision device TKN-3MB and an IR searchlight OU-3GA2. Since 2005, the BMP-3 can be fitted with a new fire control system from the &quot;Peleng&quot; Joint Stock Company from Belarus. This consists of a SOZH-M gunner&apos;s main sight with an integrated laser range-finder and missile-guidance channel, a Vesna-K targeting system with thermal imaging camera and automatic target tracker AST-B, an armament stabilisation system, a ballistic computer with data input sensors and a PL-1 IR laser projector. Since 2017, the BMP-3 is fitted with a new fire control system from the &quot;Vologda Optical-Mechanical Plant&quot; from Russia. This consists of a Sodema two-plane stabilized gunner&apos;s main sight with an integrated laser range-finder and missile-guidance channel plus a SOZH-M thermal imaging camera.
                
Standard equipment includes five firing ports with associated vision blocks, an R-173 tranceiver, an R-173P receiver, a GO-27 radiation and chemical agent detector, an FVU filtration system, an automatic fire extinguisher and six 902V &quot;Tucha-2&quot; 81 mm smoke grenade launchers.

Armored Reconnaissance Vehicle
                
BRDM is a Russian armored patrol car. It has been known by several names to include BTR-40 and the GAZ 41. There have a couple of variations that included the BDRM-1 and -2. The key differences between the two include no turret, NBC protection or night vision capability on the -1. The -2 improves upon those shortcomings by adding a turret, larger armament, and protects against small arms fire. There is a -3 listed in some manuals but it is also reported that the -3 is a 9P148 anti-tank vehicle. BDRM is translated to combat reconnaissance patrol vehicle.
                
The BRDM four-wheel-drive amphibious scout car first appeared in the spring of 1959 and rapidly became the standard light wheeled reconnaissance vehicle in most of the Warsaw Pact armies. It was replaced by the newer BRDM-2 and the Hungarian FUG scout cars. Resembling a cross between the GAZ-46 (MAY) amphibious jeep and the BTR-40 armored personnel carrier, the BRDM combines am-phibious features with full armored cover. Cross-country ability is heightened by the use of a centralized tire pressure regulation system and through the use of two sets of small belly wheels which can be lowered to add flotation and assist in crossing gaps.
                
The BRDM-1 reconnaissance 4X4 vehicle was built in a number of variants, including the BRDM-1Rkh NBC Reconnaissance Armoured car and the BRDM-1U wheeled armored command vehicle. Four versions of the BRDM are in existence: the basic BRDM reconnaissance vehicle; the BRDM-rkh radiological-chemical recon-naissance vehicle with marking-flag dispensing devices; the BRDM-U command vehicle distinguishable only by extra radio antennas; and three different antitank guided missile carriers for AT-1 SNAPPER, AT-2 SWATTER, and AT-3 SAGGER antitank missiles. All versions of the BRDM are propelled in the water by a single water jet. Recognition of the BRDM-rkh is facilitated by the presence of two canvas box-shaped devices mounted outboard on the rear deck. These are the marking-flag dispensers.

Armored Reconnaissance Vehicle
                
In an attempt to improve the amphibious characteristics and increase the combat power of their wheeled reconnaissance vehicles, the Soviets produced the BRDM-2. This vehicle differs from the original BRDM in that the powerplant has improved and moved to the rear of the vehicle, and that a small 14.5mm machinegun-armed turret has been fitted. This turret is identical to that found on the BTR-60PB armored personnel carrier. The original BRDM (BTR-40P) first appeared in 1959. The BRDM-2 also is known as BTR-40P-2 or BTR-40PB (hence also BTR-40P-2rkh or BTR-40PB-rkh, etc.). It was first seen in 1966 and by the mid-1980s was rapidly replacing the BRDM in the Soviet and Warsaw Pact armies. Care must be taken to distinguish the BRDM-2 from the Hungarian FUG (OT-65) and FUG-70 amphibious scout cars which also have rear engines but have twin waterjets.
                
The BRDM-2 series, with maximum armor of 14 mm, can be penetrated by artillery fragments and .50 caliber machine gun fire. Its tires are not protected by armor and are particularly vulnerable to puncture from fire of all kinds.
                
Like the earlier BRDM, the BRDM-2 is a fully armored, four-wheel drive, amphibious reconnaissance vehicle with two pairs of belly wheels and a centralized tire pressure regulation system for increased cross-country capability and a single water jet for propulsion through water. Externally, it differs from the BRDM due to a larger, box-like hull. It retains the boat-like bow of the BRDM, but the crew compartment has been moved farther forward and the engine has been moved to the rear. In the basic model, a small conical turret is mounted on the hull in a central position above the belly wheels. There are two front cupolas, and vision blocks are located centrally on both sides. The engine is larger than in the BRDM (140hp V-8 as opposed to 90hp 6-cylinder). The BRDM-2 is fitted with an IR spotlight and IR driving lights as well as an NBC filter system.
                
The BRDM-2 is a noticeable improvement over the BRDM-1, particularly because of its new turret and larger engine. The vehicle is also fast, simple to use and easy to control, which makes it the vehicle of choice for many third world countries. However, it still has several serious limitations. Its firepower is limited, and its armor is only capable of stopping small arms fire and some shrapnel. Even a .50-caliber machine gun is a major threat to this vehicle. As a result, its driver must avoid detection and seek protection from heavy armored units in order to survive in a combat environment.

The missile was designed to meet the RAF&apos;s requirement for a long range anti-armour weapon, allowing strike aircraft to attack tanks and armoured vehicles at stand-off range, replacing the BL755 cluster bomb. This requirement was issued following an assessment of the British military&apos;s performance in the Gulf War. GEC-Marconi (whose missile interests now form part of MBDA) was originally awarded the contract on November 7, 1996.
                
Brimstone is a &quot;fire and forget&quot; missile, which is given targeting data by the Weapon Systems Officer (WSO) prior to launch. Technically, it is programmable to adapt to a particular mission. This capability includes essentially the ability to find targets within a certain area (such as those near friendly forces), and to self-destruct if it is unable to find a target within the designated area. This information is provided to the munition by the WSO from JSTARS or local troops.
                
Brimstone has a Tandem Shaped Charge (TSC) warhead that employs a smaller initial charge, designed to initiate reactive armor, followed by a larger, more destructive charge, designed to penetrate and defeat the base armour.
                
The missile airframe is developed from Boeing&apos;s AGM-114 Hellfire, but Brimstone is an all new design with its own motor, warhead and seeker.

The BTR-60 is the first vehicle in a series of Soviet eight-wheeled armoured personnel carriers (APCs). It was developed in the late 1950s as a replacement for the BTR-152 and was seen in public for the first time in 1961. BTR stands for Bronetransporter, literally &quot;armoured transporter&quot;).
                
The BTR-152 and BTR-40, the first two Soviet mass-produced APCs developed after the Second World War, gave the Soviet Army useful experience with wheeled armoured personnel carriers. However, even as they were designed, they weren&apos;t suited for the needs of the Soviet Army as they lacked a roof (which was added in later versions designated BTR-152K and BTR-40B respectively). The low combat values of the BTR-152 and BTR-40 were exposed when the Egyptian Army used them during the Suez Crisis. This was one of the reasons why the new APC was developed.
                
Between 1956 and 1957, a decision was made to convert all rifle and mechanized divisions into motor rifle divisions and a requirement for a new transport vehicle was drawn up.

The BTR-70 is an amphibious vehicle designed solely to move troops into position quickly. As a result, it has limited armor and purely defensive weaponry, as do most armored personnel carriers. One unique feature of this vehicle is that it has dual engines, each of which powers the four wheels on one side of the vehicle. While this does provide extra power for the vehicle to go over rough ground, it can cause problems should trouble arise with one of the engines.

		<DescriptionData>
The C-17 Globemaster III is designed to fulfill airlift needs well into the 21st century, carrying large combat equipment and troops or humanitarian aid across international distances directly to small austere airfields anywhere in the world.
The C-17 is powered by four fully reversible Pratt &amp; Whitney F117-PW-100 turbofan engines integrated into the wings. Each engine is rated at 40,400 pounds of thrust, directing the flow of air upward and forward to avoid ingestion of dust and debris. These thrust reversers are operable in flight and, working with the speedbrakes, enable the aircraft to carry out rapid deceleration and descent maneuvers.
There are two operational requirements that demand reliability and maintainability from the C-17 system - an aircraft mission completion success probability of 92 percent and only 20 aircraft maintenance man-hours per flying hour.
The C-17 can carry virtually all types of Air Force air-transportable equipment - vehicles, palletized cargo, paratroopers, airdrop loads and aeromedical evacuees. Cargo is loaded onto the aircraft through a large aft door that accommodates palletized cargo and military vehicles, including large-wheeled and tracked vehicles, tanks, helicopters such as the AH-64 Apache, artillery and weapons such as the Patriot Missile system.

The Lockheed C-130 Hercules first entered service in 1956 as a transport. Since then, it has been exported to dozens of countries and still serves as a primary transport aircraft for the United States. The basic design has proven so durable and flexible that more than 20 different versions exist, from the EC-130E airborne command and control center to the AC-130U gunship, which packs a 105mm howitzer as part of its armament. Despite the tremendous air-to-ground firepower such conversions can carry, the C-130 is little more than a fat, slow target in air-to-air combat. The vast majority of C-130s are still used as transports. When so configured, the Hercules can carry up to 42,675 lbs. of cargo. The C-130 serves in the air forces of many countries worldwide.The AC-130H Spectre and AC-130U Spooky are variants of the C-130 refitted for the fire support role. The Spectre carries two M61 Vulcan guns, one L60 60mm Bofors cannon and a M102 105mm howitzer on board. It has been used in Vietnam as an interdiction and SEAD plattform.
The Spooky differs from the Spectre in it&apos;s advanced target aquisition systems and it&apos;s armament, which consists of one GAU-12 gatling gun, one L60 60mm Bofors and M102 105mm howitzer. AC-130Us flew air interdiction in the Sarajewo area during NATO&apos;s Bosnia-Herzegowina campaign.

The C-160 Transall aircraft are twin turboprop transporters in service with the air forces of France, Germany and Turkey. The aircraft is a cantilever high-wing monoplane and is configured for transportation, paratroop drop, electronic surveillance, airborne communications relay and medical evacuation.
                
The companies MBB, Nord Aviation and VFW formed the Transall group in 1959 for the development and production of the C-160 for the air forces of France, Germany, South Africa and Turkey. Production of the aircraft by the three companies ended in 1972, with 169 aircraft having been delivered.
                
In 1976, responsibility for production of the aircraft was given to Aerospatiale in France and MBB (now DaimlerChrysler Aerospace) in Germany.
                
Both companies are now part of EADS (European Aeronautics Defence and Space). Production of the aircraft from 1976 to 1985 included updated avionics, a reinforced wing housing and additional fuel tanks.
                
The C-160 fleets of France, Germany, South Africa and Turkey will be replaced by the Airbus Military A400M transport when that enters service from 2012. France has 55 aircraft still in service, Germany 80 and Turkey 20. South Africa has retired its C-160 fleet.
C-160H Astarte communications relay aircraft
                
Four communications relay aircraft, designation C-160H Astarte, were delivered to the French Air Force between 1981 and 1987. The aircraft&apos;s main mission was communications with the submerged nuclear ballistic missile submarines of the French fleet. The aircraft were equipped with unjammable VLF communications including a Rockwell VLF transmitter and a Thales communications centre. The VLF system includes dual trailing wire antennae.
                
The French Air Force retired the C-160H Astarte aircraft in 2002.
C-160 Gabriel ELINT electronic surveillance aircraft
                
The C-160 Gabriel aircraft is an upgraded electronic surveillance version in service with the French Air Force. Thales developed the signals intelligence (sigint) system. The main cabin houses the workstations and computer systems for ten elint (electronic intelligence) and comint (communications intelligence) mission crew.
                
In September 2008, Thales was awarded a contract to upgrade the ELINT system.
C-160 upgrade programmes
                
An upgrade programme for the French Air Force C-160 was completed in 1999. All C-160 Transall aircraft were upgraded with modern avionics suite and new anti-missile countermeasures between 1994 and 1999. The upgraded cockpit is equipped with a new head-up display and an upgraded electronic warfare suite, with a radar warning receiver, missile approach warner and chaff and decoy dispensers.

From 1981 on, some new C-160 reached the wings of Armee de l&apos;Air. The now C-160NG (Nouvelle Generation, New Generation) called aircraft has a fifth fuel tank in the middle of the wing above the fuselage, a refueling probe while the left side cargo door was removed. Some first-production series C-160F were fitted with the NG-versions changes and renamed C-160R (Renov).
                
Half of them has been configured as tanker aircraft for aerial refuelling. It can refuel other Transall NG, and/or fighters.

CALIFORNIA CLASS (CGN 36)
The California class of cruisers were a set of two nuclear-powered guided missile cruisers operated by the United States Navy between 1974 and 1998. Other than their nuclear power supply and lack of helicopter hangars, ships of the California class were comparable to other guided missile cruisers of their era, such as the Belknap class. The class was built as a follow-up to the nuclear-powered Long Beach, Bainbridge, and Truxtun classes. Like all of the nuclear cruisers, which could steam for years between refuelings, the California class was designed in part to provide high endurance escort for the navy's nuclear aircraft carriers, which were often limited in range due to their conventionally powered escorts continuously needing to be refueled. 
                            
Only two ships of the class were built, California and South Carolina, and both were decommissioned in late 1999. These ships were followed on by the four nuclear-powered cruisers of the Virginia class. These cruisers were named for states because they were seen as quite large, powerful, capable and survivable ships. Also, in the meantime, the names of cities had been given to the nuclear submarines in the very large Los Angeles class, which eventually expanded to 62 boats, all (but one) named for American cities.
            
Both ships underwent a mid-life refueling overhaul in the early 1990s to give them a further 18 years active service. This modernization upgraded their two 150 MW D2G reactor plants with new 165 MW D2W reactor cores, installed the New Threat Upgrade (NTU) to improve their AAW capability, and removed their ASW capability, which involved disabling their SQS-26 sonar and removing their ASROC anti-submarine weapons, though the two triple Mk 32 ASW torpedo launchers were retained. External differences resulting from this modernization included the removal of the ASROC launcher and the large deckhouse forward of it that served as the ASROC magazine, replacement of the SPS-40 radar antenna with the SPS-49 antenna, and replacement of the SPS-48C with the larger SPS-48E antenna. Both ships retained the bulbous sonar domes at the forefoot (beneath the waterline) until retirement, even after their sonar systems were disabled. While the ships were as modernized as much as possible, and were capable of service until 2010; they still were only capable of firing SM-2MR missiles from their Mk-13 launchers, and their high cost of operation made them targets for early retirement, and were both decommissioned in 1999

A cargo ship or freighter is a merchant ship that carries cargo, goods, and materials from one port to another. Thousands of cargo carriers ply the world's seas and oceans each year, handling the bulk of international trade. Cargo ships are usually specially designed for the task, often being equipped with cranes and other mechanisms to load and unload, and come in all sizes. Today, they are almost always built by welded steel, and with some exceptions generally have a life expectancy of 25 to 30 years before being scrapped.
              
Cargo shipping is vital to any war effort.

A cargo ship or freighter is a merchant ship that carries cargo, goods, and materials from one port to another. Thousands of cargo carriers ply the world's seas and oceans each year, handling the bulk of international trade. Cargo ships are usually specially designed for the task, often being equipped with cranes and other mechanisms to load and unload, and come in all sizes. Today, they are almost always built by welded steel, and with some exceptions generally have a life expectancy of 25 to 30 years before being scrapped.
              
Cargo shipping is vital to any war effort.

		</CategoryData>
		<DescriptionData>
The BLU-61/B is a spherical, grenade-like anti-personnel fragmentation bomblet about the size of a tennis ball.
         
The body of the bomb is prefragmentated and has a machined hole in nose and base to receive a thin steel bushing that runs through the bomb body. In the wide top part of this bushing the impact fuze is placed, the telescoped tail is placed in the smaller diameter afterward part of the bushing. In transport, the springloaded tail is kept in inward position by a mechanisn, existing of six air tabs, a retainer band an a wind tab. Upon release of the bomb from the dispenser the wind tab rotates, releasing the retainer band and the air tabs, enabeling the tail to move outward, forming the aerodynamic stabilizer. The  BLU-49/B  was  designed  to  penetate  jungle  foilage  and  detonate  on  ground  impact.  The  main  difference  between  the  BLU49/B  and  the  BLU-49A/B  was  that  the  BLU-49A/B  had  a  slightly  different  nose  with  a  foil  covering  instead  of  a  protruding  shipping  pin.  The  shipping  pin  is  connected  to  the  telescope pipe of the tail and with the tail in forward (safe) position- keeps the fuze in a safe position , unable to arm untill the tail has fully extended. The fuze is fixated in the fuze well by means of a circlip. Two other types of BLU-49 bomblets were the  BLU-49B/B, which has a pyroforic liner for an additional incendiary effect and the BLU- 87/B, which has a detonation delay of 0,015 seconds.
        
Functioning of the fuze: Shortly after release of the bomblet, the tail extends and the shipping pin is retracted. The arming wheel is released and the clockspring will start to  rotate  the  arming  wheel. The arming wheel has a toothgear on the outside,  which  grips  in  a  speed  reduction  gear  box (2). This enshures the bomblet is not armed in the vincinity of the aircraft which released it.  The lower side of the arming wheel (8)  has a Y shaped  indentation,  in  which  a  Y  shaped  key  fits  that  forms  the  lower  part  of  the  arming  key  (9).   In   safe   (lower)   position   the   arming   key   keeps   the   three   inertia   ring   segments   (12)   locked  tight  in  inward  position.  These  inertia  weights     keep     in     inward     position-     the     springloaded     firingpin     (18)     in     downward     position.  The  firingpin  in  downward  position-  keeps  the  rotation  shutter  (13)  with  the  firing  cap  in  a  locked  position,  out  of  line  with  the  detonator (16).
            
When the arming wheel has rotated approximately 60 degrees, the Y shaped key of the arming key fits into Y shaped indentation, thereby  moving  upward,  releasing  the  three  inertia  ring  segments  (12)  to  move  in  an  outward  position,  forced  by  the  firing  pin  (spring) (8) moving upward. The rising firing pin releases  the  rotation  shutter  (13)  which  will  rotate  the  firing  cap  (F)  between  the  firing  pin  and  the  detonator  (16).  The  fuze  is  now  fully  armed. There are two ways to activate the firing pin: -  Hydraulic  /  pneumatic  :    In  the  nosecap  (3)  of  the fuze four holes are drilled. To the underside of this nosecap a cup (4) is spotwelded in which a   springloaded   striker   pin   (5)   is   placed.   A   connecting  pin  (10)  is  placed  in  a  hole  drilled  through  the  center  of  the  arming  key  (9).  Upon  impact on water, mud or swamp, the striker pin (5) will be hit back by the hydraulic / pneumatic force,     pushing     the     connecting     pin     (10)     backward,  so  forcing  the  firing  pin  (8)  into  the  firing  cap  (F).  This  will  ignite  the  detonator,  booster and main charge.

The submunition in the CBU-52 is softball sized and effective against soft-skinned targets. The dispenser holds 220 of the submunitions and is best used against personnel or light-skinned vehicles. The CBU-52, loaded with 220 antimaterial, antipersonnel bomblets, weighs 785 pounds and can be used with a variety of proximity fuzes or the mechanical MK-339 timed fuze. The submunition is a 3.5-inch spherical bomblet weighing 2.7 pounds with a 0.65-pound high-explosive warhead.
                
The CBU-52, -58 and -71 all use SUU-30 dispensers, a metal cylinder divided longitudinally. One-half contains a strong back section that provides for forced ejection and sway-bracing. The two halves lock together. Four cast aluminum fins are attached at a 9 degree angle to the aft end of the dispenser and are canted 1.25 degrees to impart spin-stabilized flight. When released from the aircraft, the arming wire/lanyard initiates the fuze arming and delay cycle. At fuze function, the fuze booster ignites and unlocks the forward end of the dispenser. Ram air action on the dispenser forces the two halves apart, instantaneously dispensing the payload and allowing the bomblets to spin-arm and self-dispense. A total of 17,831 were expended during the Gulf War.

The the 550-pound CBU-55/72 cluster bomb contains three submunitions known as fuel/air explosive (FAE). The submunitions weigh approximately 100 pounds and contain 75 pounds of ethylene oxide with air-burst fuzing set for 30 feet. An aerosol cloud approximately 60 feet in diameter and 8 feet thick is created and ignited by an embedded detonator to produce an explosion. This cluster munition is effective against minefields, armored vehicles, aircraft parked in the open, and bunkers. During Desert Storm the Marine Corps dropped all 254 CBU-72s, primarily from A-6Es, against mine fields and personnel in trenches. Some secondary explosions were noted when it was used as a mine clearer; however, FAE was primarily useful as a psychological weapon. Second-generation FAE weapons were developed from the FAE I type devices (CBU-55/72) used in Vietnam. The original CBU-55 was employed from helicopters and low-performance aircraft such as the AH-1 and OV-10D.
                
The CBU-55A is an imporved version featuring an external hardback allowing it to be carried by higherperformance
aircraft.
                
The CBU-72 is a CBU-55A equiped with the same Mk-339 fuze used by the Mk-7 dispensor.

The CBU-58 is loaded with 650 bomblets. These bomblets contain 5-gram titanium pellets, making them incendiary and useful against flammable targets. The CBU-58 cluster munition disperses 650 BLU-63 anti-personnel bomblets. The weapon consists of a SUU-30 dispenser carrying BLU-63 self-dispersing sub-munitions. The BLU-63 combines high explosives with two incendiary 5g titanium pellets to set inflammable targets alight. After the bomb is released, the SUU-30 case blows open scattering the bomblets over a wide area. The CBU-58 is effective against infantry, lightly armored vehicles, parked aircraft and similar soft targets.
                
More than 17,000 CBU-52 and CBU-58 cluster bombs were dropped during Desert Storm. The CBU-24, -49, -52, -58 and -71 all use SUU-30 dispensers, a metal cylinder divided longitudinally.
One-half contains a strong back section that provides for forced ejection and sway-bracing. The two halves lock together. Four cast aluminum fins are attached at a 9~degree angle to the aft end of the dispenser and are canted 1.25 degrees to impart spin-stabilized flight. When released from the aircraft, the arming wire/lanyard initiates the fuze arming and delay cycle. At fuze function, the fuze booster ignites and unlocks the forward end of the dispenser.

The CBU-72 consisted of three fuel-air explosive (FAE) submunitions. Each submunition weighed about 100 pounds and dispensed a cloud approximately 60 feet in diameter and 8 feet thick composed of its 75 pounds of ethylene oxide aerosol fuel across the target area, with air-burst fusing set for 30 feet.[1] An embedded detonator ignited the cloud as it descended to the ground to produce a massive explosion. The high-pressure of the rapidly expanding wave front flattened all objects within close proximity of the epicenter of the fuel cloud, as well as causing debilitating damage well beyond it. Like other FAE using ethylene oxide, in the event of non-ignition, it functions as a chemical weapon, due to the highly toxic nature of this gas.

The CBU-87B Combined Effects Munition (CEM) dispenses 202 BLU-97 bomblets, which cause damage in three ways. Light armor, structures and personnel are susceptible to shrapnel from the bomblet casing. An incendiary zirconium ring inside the bomblet will ignite combustible material. Finally, a shaped charge fires a jet of molten copper capable of penetrating several inches of armor plating. The CBU-87B dispenser spins at up to 2500 rpm before bursting open to dispense the bomblets over a wide area.
The CBU-87 is a good choice for targets of mixed types such as SAM sites (which might consist of lightly armored TELs, stocks of missiles, antennae, control vans, trucks and personnel) or mechanized infantry units. The CBU-58, carrying more bomblets, will probably be more effective pound-for-pound against soft targets.
More than 10,000 CBU-87 bombs were dropped during Desert Storm.

The CBU-89 Gator is a 1,000-pound class cluster bomb containing anti-tank and anti-personnel mines. The anti-tank mine is triggered by a magnetic sensor and the anti-personnel mine are triggered by trip wires. The purpose of this weapon when released from tactical aircraft is to create rapidly minefields to deny access to a given area to moving ground forces or to immobilize targets.
                
The Gator mine dispensing system consists of SUU-66/B tactical munitions dispenser, 72 BLU-91/B anti-tank mines and 22 BLU-92/B anti-personnel mines. Fitted with the Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser (WCMD) tail kit it can be released from higher altitudes for enhanced aircraft survivability. The minefield area will depend on the release altitude of the Gator, higher altitude means the mines will be dispersed throughout a larger area and vice versa.

The CBU-94 Graphite Bomb is the so-called &quot;Black-out bomb&quot; for attacking electrical power infrastructure, dispense carbon filaments to short-circuit electrical power distribution equipment.
                
First used on 02 May 1999 as part of Operation ALLIED FORCE when F-117A Nighthawks attacked targets in Serbia. In the wake of these strikes lights went out in over 70 per cent of the country. The munition was used again on the night of 07 May 1999 to counter Serbian efforts to restore damage caused by the initial attack.

The CBU-97 is a 1,000-pound class weapon containing sensor-fused submunitions for attacking armor. The SFW is the centerpiece of the Air Force concept of operations for engaging an adversary&apos;s main armored force in the &quot;halt&quot; or &quot;hold&quot; phase of a Major Regional Contingency, in which the USAF would disrupt and stop an attack, providing time for other combatant forces to reinforce to the theater.
                
The primary components of this 1,000 pound class weapon are the SUU-66/B Tactical Munitions Dispenser (TMD), 10 BLU-108/B submunitions, and 40 &quot;hockey puck&quot; shaped skeet infrared sensing projectiles. The weapon is designed to be employed from US Air Force tactical aircraft from altitudes between 200 feet Above Ground Level (AGL) to 20,000 feet Mean Sea Level (MSL) at speeds between 250 to 650 knots. Each CBU-97/B can cover an area of about 500 feet by 1,200 feet. Test results indicate that CBU-97 submunitions have a propensity to cluster and that impact patterns are unevenly distributed. This is contrary to the uniform distribution assumption employed in the Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manual (JMEM). Because of the clustering effect, it appears that JMEM overestimates damage and more weapons may be required to destroy the target then predicted.
The Sensor Fuzed Weapon [SFW] is an unpowered, top attack, wide area, cluster munition, designed to achieve multiple kills per aircraft pass against enemy armor and support vehicles. After release, the TMD opens and dispenses the ten submunitions which are parachute stabilized. Each of the 10 BLU-108/B submunitions contains four armor-penetrating projectiles with infrared sensors to detect armored targets. At a preset altitude sensed by a radar altimeter, a rocket motor fires to spin the submunition and initiate an ascent. The submunition then releases its four projectiles, which are lofted over the target area. The projectile&apos;s sensor detects a vehicle&apos;s infrared signature, and an explosively formed penetrator fires at the heat source. If no target is detected after a period of time, the projectiles automatically after a preset time interval, causing damage to material and personnel.
A Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) Program will take the existing design and make modifications to the projectile sensor, incorporating a dual mode (active/passive IR) for better target detection; modify the warhead to enhance soft target lethality; and increase the system footprint for better target coverage. Projectiles would be dispensed at a greater altitude expanding the area covered to about 600 feet by 1,800 feet. In addition, an insensitive explosive fill will replace the Octol used in the current warhead to satisfy Navy requirements for the BLU-108/B submunition used in one variant of the Joint Stand-Off Weapon (JSOW).

Wind Corrected Munition Dispenser (WCMD)
CBU-103 / CBU-104 / CBU-105 / CBU-107
                
While low altitude, high speed laydown deliveries are consistent with tactics used against heavily defended target sets such as the robust Soviet/Warsaw Pact threat envisioned in Central Europe, low altitude tactics were not the preferred option during Desert Storm where the USAF used medium/high altitude weapons employment to provide fighter and bomber aircraft a sanctuary against short range surface to air missiles and anti-aircraft artillery fire. The inexpensive tail kit inertially steers the munition from a known release point to precise target coordinates while compensating for launch transients, winds aloft, surface winds and adverse weather.
                
The Wind Compensated Munitions Dispenser [WCMD &quot;Wick-Mid&quot;] is intended to remedy this current shortfall in Tactical Munition Dispenser munitions, such as the CBU-87 CEM [Combined Effects Munition], CBU-89 GATOR and CBU-97 SFW [Sensor Fuzed Weapon]. The weapon will use inertial guidance only (no GPS). The WCMD program develops a tail kit for these inventory dispenser weapons. These weapons will be capable of delivery from medium to high altitude delivery when equipped with a WCMD kit. The WCMD weapon will correct for wind effects and errors during the weapon&apos;s ballistic fall. The WCMD kit will turn these &quot;dumb&quot; bombs into accurate &quot;smart&quot; weapons. Currently, the dispenser is achieving an accuracy of within 30 feet. Both fighter and bomber aircraft will be able to employ WCMD from a wide range of altitudes, in adverse weather, using various tactics such as level, dive, and toss bombing, and bombing on coordinates.
                
WCMD Limited Initial Operational Capability was achieved on the B-52 in November 1998. The first WCMDs were operationally fielded in 2000, when the weapon was certified for use on the B-52 and F-16. WCMD-equipped weapons are planned for employment on the B-1, B-52, F-15E, F-16, and F-117 aircraft. WCMD went into full production in April 2001. By the end of November 2001, a total of 600 cluster bombs had been dropped over Afghanistan, consisting of 450 BLU-103 and 150 BLU-87 munitions. As of September 2002 the Air Force had dropped about 700 WCMD bombs in Afghanistan from B-52 bombers and F-16 fighters, by which time about 7,000 of the specialized inertial guidance navigation tail kits remained in inventory.
                
The WCMD is seen as one solution to four deficiencies identified in the Strategic Attack/Air Interdiction Mission Area Plan (MAP): multiple kills per pass, adverse weather capability, Cluster Bomb accuracy (mid-course wind correction), and the ability to carry/dispense future submunitions and US Army mines. With the addition of a guidance kit and &quot;smart&quot; aircraft stores stations, aircrew members should be able to independently target weapons and strike multiple targets on a single release/pass. WCMD will be targetable by on-board aircraft systems and be capable of being targeted on a coordinate reference system. To minimize aircraft heading, velocity, and position errors, all aircraft will have Global Positioning System (GPS) quality heading, velocity, and altitude data. This will provide aircraft an adverse weather capability for targets with known positions. GPS is not required on the WCMD. The guidance kit will provide WCMD an adverse weather capability and negate a need for electro-optical guidance systems which are severely degraded by adverse weather or man-made or battlefield obscurants such as smoke or dust. The WCMD kit will reduce susceptibility to wind induced errors, not fully compensated for by aircraft avionics, by providing mid-course wind correction. Finally, the modular design of the SUU-64/65/66 Tactical Munition Dispensers (TMD) allows for future incorporation of wide area anti-armor mines, anti-helicopter mines, and other future smart submunitions.
                
The Air Force announced 27 January 1997 that Lockheed Martin had won the $21 million contract to complete development and begin production of the Wind-Corrected Munition Dispenser. The total value of the program, including development and production, is about $650 million. The Air Force plans to modify 40,000 tactical munitions dispensers -- 30,000 for CEM and 5,000 each for Gator and SFW.
                
Department of Defense officials originally predicted the dispenser tail kits would cost approximately $25,000 per unit. However, through the application of a no-nonsense acquisition strategy adopted by the Eglin WCMD team, the dispenser unit cost is $8,937.

The inexpensive tail kit inertially steers the munition from a known release point to precise target coordinates while compensating for launch transients, winds aloft, surface winds and adverse weather.
                
The Wind Compensated Munitions Dispenser [WCMD &quot;Wick-Mid&quot;] is intended to remedy this current shortfall in Tactical Munition Dispenser munitions, such as the CBU-87 CEM [Combined Effects Munition], CBU-89 GATOR and CBU-97 SFW [Sensor Fuzed Weapon]. The weapon will use inertial guidance only (no GPS). The WCMD program develops a tail kit for these inventory dispenser weapons. These weapons will be capable of delivery from medium to high altitude delivery when equipped with a WCMD kit. The WCMD weapon will correct for wind effects and errors during the weapon&apos;s ballistic fall. The WCMD kit will turn these &quot;dumb&quot; bombs into accurate &quot;smart&quot; weapons. Currently, the dispenser is achieving an accuracy of within 30 feet. Both fighter and bomber aircraft will be able to employ WCMD from a wide range of altitudes, in adverse weather, using various tactics such as level, dive, and toss bombing, and bombing on coordinates.
                
WCMD Limited Initial Operational Capability was achieved on the B-52 in November 1998. The first WCMDs were operationally fielded in 2000, when the weapon was certified for use on the B-52 and F-16. WCMD-equipped weapons are planned for employment on the B-1, B-52, F-15E, F-16, and F-117 aircraft. WCMD went into full production in April 2001. By the end of November 2001, a total of 600 cluster bombs had been dropped over Afghanistan, consisting of 450 BLU-103 and 150 BLU-87 munitions. As of September 2002 the Air Force had dropped about 700 WCMD bombs in Afghanistan from B-52 bombers and F-16 fighters, by which time about 7,000 of the specialized inertial guidance navigation tail kits remained in inventory.
                
The WCMD is seen as one solution to four deficiencies identified in the Strategic Attack/Air Interdiction Mission Area Plan (MAP): multiple kills per pass, adverse weather capability, Cluster Bomb accuracy (mid-course wind correction), and the ability to carry/dispense future submunitions and US Army mines. With the addition of a guidance kit and &quot;smart&quot; aircraft stores stations, aircrew members should be able to independently target weapons and strike multiple targets on a single release/pass. WCMD will be targetable by on-board aircraft systems and be capable of being targeted on a coordinate reference system. To minimize aircraft heading, velocity, and position errors, all aircraft will have Global Positioning System (GPS) quality heading, velocity, and altitude data. This will provide aircraft an adverse weather capability for targets with known positions. GPS is not required on the WCMD. The guidance kit will provide WCMD an adverse weather capability and negate a need for electro-optical guidance systems which are severely degraded by adverse weather or man-made or battlefield obscurants such as smoke or dust. The WCMD kit will reduce susceptibility to wind induced errors, not fully compensated for by aircraft avionics, by providing mid-course wind correction. Finally, the modular design of the SUU-64/65/66 Tactical Munition Dispensers (TMD) allows for future incorporation of wide area anti-armor mines, anti-helicopter mines, and other future smart submunitions.
                
The Air Force announced 27 January 1997 that Lockheed Martin had won the $21 million contract to complete development and begin production of the Wind-Corrected Munition Dispenser. The total value of the program, including development and production, is about $650 million. The Air Force plans to modify 40,000 tactical munitions dispensers -- 30,000 for CEM and 5,000 each for Gator and SFW.
                
Department of Defense officials originally predicted the dispenser tail kits would cost approximately $25,000 per unit. However, through the application of a no-nonsense acquisition strategy adopted by the Eglin WCMD team, the dispenser unit cost is $8,937.

The Centurion, introduced in 1945, was the primary British main battle tank of the post-Second World War period. It is widely considered to be one of the most successful post-war tank designs, remaining in production into the 1960s, and seeing combat in the front lines into the 1980s. The chassis was also adapted for several other roles, and these have remained in service to this day.
                
Development of the tank began in 1943 and manufacture of the Centurion began in January 1945, six prototypes arriving in Belgium less than a month after the war in Europe ended in May 1945. It first entered combat with the British Army in the Korean War in 1950, in support of the UN forces. The Centurion later served in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, where it fought against US-supplied M47 and M48 Patton tanks and it served with the Royal Australian Armoured Corps in Vietnam.
                
Israel used Centurions in the 1967 Six Day War, 1973 Yom Kippur War, and during the 1978 and 1982 invasions of Lebanon. Centurions modified as armoured personnel carriers were used in Gaza, the West Bank and on the Lebanese border. The Royal Jordanian Land Force used Centurions, first in 1970 to fend off a Syrian incursion within its borders during the Black September events and later in the Golan Heights in 1973. South Africa deployed its Centurions in Angola during the South African Border War.
                
It became one of the most widely used tank designs, equipping armies around the world, with some still in service until the 1990s. As recently as the 2006 Israe / Lebanon conflict the Israel Defense Forces employed heavily modified Centurions as armoured personnel carriers and combat engineering vehicles. The South African National Defence Force still employs over 200 Centurions, which were modernised in the 1980s and 2000s as the Olifant.
                
Between 1946 and 1962, 4,423 Centurions were produced, consisting of 13 basic marks and numerous variants. In British Army use it was replaced by the Chieftain.

The Cerberus III is an airbone radar jammer in use only with German forces.
                
The Cerberus I Pod belongs to the illegal Ray II Dark set. It is a modified version of the Wave Pod, but also is like the Double Wave Pod. It sends out three dark red wave blasts at the same time, but its range is average.
                
This pod is one of the few illegal parts that change the tactical uses compared to it&apos;s legal counterpart. Since it fires blasts to your sides and in front of you it should be used in close range combat followed by a short-medium ranged gun.

In the early 1960s, Sikorsky&apos;s work on the S-60 and the derived S-64 flying crane helicopter designs stood the company in good stead when the U.S. Marine Corps issued an exacting requirement for a new assault helicopter. The company responded with its S-65 design that drew on Sikorsky&apos;s experience with the S-64 (CH-54 Tarhe) and S-61R (CH-3) in the design of the dynamic system and watertight hull respectively. The U.S. Marine Corps was impressed with the preliminary design, and in August 1962 ordered two YCH-65A prototype and service test helicopters.
The first of these machines flew in October 1964 with a powerplant of two T64-GE-3 turboshafts, each rated at 2,850 shp (2,125 kW), and soon confirmed its ability to lift 38 troops or 24 litters as alternatives to a heavy freight load carried internally or externally.
The U.S. Marine Corps ordered an eventual 139 examples of the CH-53A initial production model, which entered service in the fall of 1966. As delivered initially, the CH-53A was fitted with a powerplant of two T64-GE-6 turboshafts, each rated at 2,850 shp (2,125 kW), but later helicopters switched to two T64-GE-1 turboshafts, each rated at 3,080 shp (2,297 kW) and then to two T64-GE-16 turboshafts, each rated at 3,435 shp (2,561 kW) for improved performance with a payload that could include one 4.13 in (105 mm) howitzer and ammunition, or 38 troops, or 24 litters plus four attendants, or more than 8,000 lbs (3,629 kg) of freight carried in the hold, or alternatively more than 13,000 lbs (5,897 kg) of freight carried as a slung load. The hold is 30 ft (9.14 m) long, 7 ft 6 in (2.29 m) wide and 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) high, and access is provided by a hydraulically-operated ventral ramp/door and a door on the forward starboard side.
All but 32 of the helicopters were built with provision for the towing of a minesweeping sled.
In other respects, the CH-53A differs from the HH-53C in details such as its normal take-off weight of 35,000 lbs (15,876 kg), its maximum clean level speed of 169 kts (195 mph; 314 km/h) at sea level, its cruising speed of 149 kts (172 mph; 277 km/h) at sea level, its range of 223 nm (257 miles; 413 km), its endurance of more than 4 hours, its maximum rate of climb at sea level of 2,240 ft (683 m) per minute, and its service ceiling of 18,550 ft (5,655 m).

The FV4030/4 Challenger 1 is a British main battle tank (MBT) used by the British Army from 1983 to the mid-1990s, when it was superseded by the Challenger 2. It is also currently used by the Royal Jordanian Army as its main battle tank, after heavy modifications. The variants for the Jordanian military are to be upgraded using the unmanned Falcon turret.
                
The Challenger design by the former Military Vehicles and Engineering Establishment (MVEE) near Chobham in Surrey originated in an Iranian order for an improved version of the Chieftain line of tanks in service around the world. These were the Chieftain Mk5(P)- FV4030/1, FV4030/2 Shir (Lion) 1 and 4030/3 Shir 2. With the fall of the Shah of Iran and the collapse of the UK MBT-80 project, the British Army became the customer and the tank was further developed by MVEE to meet Western European requirements. For a short time the tank was named &quot;Cheviot&quot; (the name of a hill range) before becoming &quot;Challenger&quot;, a name reused from the Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger tank of World War II.
                
The most advanced aspect of the Challenger 1 design was its Chobham armour, which gave protection far superior to any monolithic Rolled Homogeneous Armour (RHA), then standard of western tank armour material. This armour was later adopted by other designs, including the American M1 Abrams. Additionally, the hydropneumatic suspension provided outstanding cross-country performance through the long suspension arm travel and controlled bump and rebound behaviour offered.
                
The Challenger was built by the Royal Ordnance Factories (ROF). Challenger 1 entered service with the British Army in 1983 and production ceased in 1990 at a cost of around £2 million each. In 1986, ROF Leeds (and the Challenger production line) was acquired by Vickers Defence Systems (later Alvis Vickers). Jordan initially purchased 274 Challenger 1 tanks. Under an agreement signed in March 1999, another 288 surplus Challenger 1s were supplied to Jordan over a three-year period, which enabled the Jordanian Centurion fleet (known locally as Tariq) to be replaced.[2]
                
The Ministry of Defence was keen to show off the capabilities of the Challenger 1 in the Canadian Army Trophy Competition (CAT &apos;87), held at Grafenwhr, West Germany, in June 1987. The best performing team in preparatory competitions had been the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment, although its Challengers had not been fitted with Thermal Observation and Gunnery Sight (TOGS), which would put them at a disadvantage. The Royal Hussars had a squadron fitted with TOGS; however, they had been training at BATUS in Canada with Chieftains, instead of training with Challenger and TOGS for CAT &apos;87. Twenty-two new Challengers with TOGS were specially diverted from the production line for the competition, resulting in teething problems. At the competition itself, the Hussars managed some creditable scores but overall, their three &quot;platoons&quot; were placed last in the league table. In a statement to the House of Commons on 14 July, Ian Stewart, the Minister of State for the Armed Forces, said; &quot;I do not believe that the performance of tanks in the artificial circumstances of a competition, such as the recent Canadian Army Trophy, is a proper indication of their capability in war.&quot; Following poor results in 1985 with Chieftain, and in 1987 with Challenger, the British Army decided in December 1987 to withdraw indefinitely from the competition.
                
A requirement for a new MBT was later issued. Proposals put forward for the new specification included an improved Challenger from Vickers, the American M1 Abrams, the French Leclerc, and the German Leopard 2. The Vickers Defence Systems design, designated Challenger 2, was eventually selected. This tank is significantly more capable than its predecessor: based on the same basic MVEE-designed hull, it features a new turret based on the Vickers Private Venture Mk7 design and improved Chobham armour.
                
Withdrawals of British Army Challenger 1 began in 1998 and it had been completely replaced by Challenger 2 by 2001.
                
There was also a Challenger Marksman SPAAG version, equipped with the Marksman turret.

The FV4034 Challenger 2 (MOD designation &quot;CR2&quot;) is a British main battle tank (MBT) in service with the armies of the United Kingdom and Oman. It was designed and built by the British company Vickers Defence Systems (now known as BAE Systems Land &amp; Armaments).
                
Vickers Defence Systems began to develop a successor to Challenger 1 as a private venture in 1986. A £90 million deal for a demonstrator vehicle was finalised in January 1989. In June 1991, the Ministry of Defence placed a £520 million order for 140 vehicles, with a further 268 ordered in 1994. Production began in 1993 and the unit&apos;s tanks were delivered in July 1994, replacing the Challenger 1. The tank entered service with the British Army in 1998, with the last delivered in 2002. It is expected to remain in service until 2035. The Royal Army of Oman ordered 18 Challenger 2s in 1993 and a further 20 tanks in November 1997.
                
The Challenger 2 is an extensive redesign of the Challenger 1. Although the hull and automotive components seem similar, they are of a newer design and build than those of the Challenger 1 and only around 3% of components are interchangeable. A visual recognition feature is the armoured housing for the TOGS thermal gunsight; the Challenger 2 has this above the gun barrel, the Challenger 1 has it at the right hand side of the turret. The tank&apos;s drive system provides a 550 km range, with a maximum road speed of 59 km/h.
                
The Challenger 2 is equipped with a 120-millimetre (4.7 in) 55-calibre long L30A1 tank gun, the successor to the L11 gun used on the Chieftain and Challenger 1. Unique among NATO main battle tank armament, the L30A1 is rifled, because the British Army continues to place a premium on the use of High-explosive squash head (HESH) rounds in addition to armour-piercing fin-stabilised discarding-sabot rounds. The Challenger 2 is also armed with a L94A1 EX-34 7.62 mm chain gun and a 7.62 mm L37A2 (GPMG) machine gun. Fifty [10] main armament rounds and 4,200 rounds of 7.62 mm ammunition are carried.
                
The Challenger 2 has a four-man crew. The turret and hull are protected with second generation Chobham armour (also known as Dorchester). On one occasion, in August 2006, during the post-invasion stage of the Iraq War, an RPG-29 was fired at a Challenger 2 that was climbing over a ramp. The armour on its front underside hull, which was augmented with an explosive reactive armour package, was damaged, injuring several crew members. The tank subsequently returned to base under its own power and was quickly repaired and back on duty the following day. As a response to the incident, the explosive reactive armour package was replaced with a Dorchester block and the steel underbelly lined with armour as part of the &apos;Streetfighter&apos; upgrade. To date, the only time the tank has been seriously damaged during operations was by another Challenger 2 in a &apos;blue on blue&apos; (friendly fire) incident at Basra in 2003 when the damaged tank had its hatch open at the time of the incident.
                
It has seen operational service in Bosnia, Kosovo and Iraq.

Originally the Crotale R440 system was developed by Rockwell International and Thomson-Houston (and Mistral) in France for South Africa, where it was named Cactus. However, the achievements of the system impressed the French Armed Forces, who purchased the system both for the air force and for the navy.
                      
The firing system includes the main sensors of the ship, the firing system of the turret, and a central coordination system. The turret holds eight missiles ready for launch in watertight containers. The magazine behind the turret holds 18 missiles.
        
The French army first utilised a 4x4 wheeled vehicle, armed with four launchers. In order to ensure higher mobility, it was decided to mount the system on the chassis of the French AMX-30 main battle tank. At the same time, the number of launchers were increased to six. In Finnish Army service, the Crotale NG system has been mounted on Sisu Pasi vehicles. Here the number of launchers is eight.
        
The Crotale system has also been installed on various military ships. For instance the French Navy La Fayette class frigates have a Crotale 8-tubed launcher near the helicopter flight deck

The YJ-83 (literally: 'eagle strike 83'; NATO reporting name: CSS-N-8 Saccade) is a Chinese subsonic anti-ship cruise missile. It is manufactured by the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation Third Academy.
         
The YJ-83 uses microprocessors and a strapdown inertial reference unit (IRU); these are more compact than the equivalent electronics used in the YJ-8 and the export C-802, allowing the YJ-83 to have a 180-km range at Mach 0.9. The missile is powered by the Chinese CTJ-2 turbojet, and carries 190-kg high-explosive fragmentation warhead. Terminal guidance is by an active radar. The YJ-83K, the air-launched variant, has a range of 200 km. This data may be for an improved YJ-83A; the original YJ-83 may have shorter range, at 120 km and 130 km for the surface- and air-launched versions, respectively.
           
The YJ-83KH has an electro-optical seeker, and may receive course corrections by remote link.
          
The YJ-83 entered service with the People's Liberation Army Navy in 1998-1999 and has equipped a large number of its surface warships. The YJ-83K equips the Xian JH-7 and H-6G.
        
The C-802 is the export version of the YJ-83; It is powered by the French TRI 60-2 turbojet and has a range of 65 nautical miles (120 km).
          
The C-802A and C-802AK are the export surface- and air-launched variants. The C-802A has a range of 100 nautical miles (190 km).

The USS Entreprise was the world&apos;s second nuclear powered ship (the cruiser Long Beach CGN-9 was completed a few months earlier). From 1961 to 1972 she was the biggest warship in the world. She is still the longest carrier in the Navy at 1,123 feet, also being the tallest (250 feet) and fastest (30+ nautical miles per hour). Back in the 1960s, this astounding vessel marked the culmination of the Navy&apos;s development of shipboard aviation, a development begun within the service lives of many still on active duty with the conversion, in 1922, of the old 15-knot collier Jupiter into the Langley as an experimental aircraft carrier.
                
In July 1964, Enterprise, along with USS Long Beach and USS Bainbridge, were designated Task Force One and sent on &quot;Operation Sea Orbit,&quot; a historic 30,565-mile voyage around the world, accomplished without a single refueling or replenishment. It was also the world&apos;s first nuclear-powered task force.
                
She served in the Mediterranean, helped in the blockade of Cuba in 1962, and became the first nuclear ship to enter combat when her aircraft struck targets in Vietnam.
                
In July 1975, Enterprise&apos;s designation was changed from CVA-65 to CVN-65, to better reflect its multi-mission capabilities.
                
From 1979 to 1982 Enterprise remained docked at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, receiving a reconstructed island and numerous improvements. And in October 1990 Enterprise moved to Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company for refueling and the Navy&apos;s largest complex overhaul ever attempted, being updated for service through 2015. Enterprise completed its overhaul, the most extensive in U.S. Naval history, on Sept. 27, 1994.
                
Enterprise is scheduled to be replaced by CVX-78 in 2013; by that time, she will be 52 years old.
Enterprise was finally decommissed 3 February 2017.

The Nimitz-class supercarriers are a class of ten nuclear-powered aircraft carriers in service with the United States Navy. The lead ship of the class is named for World War II United States Pacific Fleet commander Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, the U.S. Navy&apos;s last fleet admiral. With an overall length of 1,092 ft (333 m) and full-load displacement of over 100,000 long tons,[1] they have been the largest warships built and in service.
                
Instead of the gas turbines or diesel-electric systems used for propulsion on many modern warships, the carriers use two A4W pressurized water reactors which drive four propeller shafts and can produce a maximum speed of over 30 knots (56 km/h) and maximum power of around 260,000 shp (190 MW). As a result of the use of nuclear power, the ships are capable of operating for over 20 years without refueling and are predicted to have a service life of over 50 years. They are categorized as nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and are numbered with consecutive hull numbers between CVN-68 and CVN-77.
                
All ten carriers were constructed by Newport News Shipbuilding Company in Virginia. USS Nimitz, the lead ship of the class, was commissioned on 3 May 1975, and USS George H.W. Bush, the tenth and last of the class, was commissioned on 10 January 2009. Since the 1970s, Nimitz-class carriers have participated in many conflicts and operations across the world, including Operation Eagle Claw in Iran, the Gulf War, and more recently in Iraq and Afghanistan.
                
The angled flight decks of the carriers use a CATOBAR arrangement to operate aircraft, with steam catapults and arrestor wires for launch and recovery. As well as speeding up flight deck operations, this allows for a much wider variety of aircraft than with the STOVL arrangement used on smaller carriers. An embarked carrier air wing consisting of up to around 90 aircraft is normally deployed on board.[citation needed] After the retirement of the F-14 Tomcat, the air wings&apos; strike fighters are primarily F/A-18E and F/A-18F Super Hornets and F/A-18A+ and F/A-18C Hornets. In addition to their aircraft, the vessels carry short-range defensive weaponry for anti-aircraft warfare and missile defense.

The Delilah missile is a cruise missile or loitering munition developed in Israel by Israel Military Industries (IMI).
                
The missile is designed to target moving and re-locatable targets with a circular error probable (CEP) of 1 metre (3 ft 3 in). Unlike a typical cruise missile, which is locked onto a pre-programmed target prior to launch, the Delilah missile&apos;s unique feature, as claimed by the manufacturer, is being able to loiter and surveil an area before a remote weapon systems officer, usually from the launching fighter aircraft, identifies the specific target of the attack.
                          
On 9 May 2018, Delilah missiles were fired at Syrian and Iranian targets, including anti-aircraft systems, such SA-5, SA-2, SA-22, and SA-17 units.

The flight crew of an E-3 consists of 4 airmen. The other 13 crew members operate the Sentry&apos;s sophisticated onboard electronics. The aircraft&apos;s comprehensive suite includes electronic countermeasures (ECM), airborne early warning radar (AEW), electronic intelligence equipment (ELINT) and other communications and jamming equipment. The Sentry can detect, identify, and simultaneously track thousands of missiles or aircraft from hundreds of miles away, regardless of weather, terrain or altitude. The Sentry is also used to direct friendly aircraft in combat engagements. The E-3 greatly enhances the combat effectiveness of any force it flies with, but is itself no combatant. The Sentry relies on its ECM and detection capabilities to evade trouble, using its anti-aircraft missiles in only the most desperate self-defense situations. Versions of the E-3 serve with the air forces of the United States, France, England and Saudi Arabia.

The Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System was proposed to fulfill a need for low-risk battlefield surveillance. The JSTARS proposal called for an aircraft that could remain in friendly territory while using a large onboard radar to provide telemetry and battlefield updates to forces engaged behind enemy lines.
Boeing, working with Northrop Grumman, retrofitted existing 707&apos;s with a large Norden phased-array multi-mode radar capable of operating in both synthetic-aperture and Doppler-pulse modes. The radar itself was mounted in a canoe fairing measuring some 24 feet in length. After the cancellation of the E-6B, the final JSTARS would be the E-6C, built from retrofitted 707-300&apos;s.
Radar information gathered by the E-6C is processed by four 600+ MHz processors and delivered to 18 graphic consoles including one tasked solely for self-defense work. The radar is capable of identifying slow-moving ground vehicles to a limited extent, plotting flight paths, and even producing photographic terrain maps, all for delivery to consoles on aircraft and vehicles through the SCDL equipment. The E-8 works in conjunction with a network of U.S. Army Ground Mobile Station&apos;s (typically Motorola TSQ-132S-280&apos;s) to provide complete battlefield coverage.
Although the USAF currently has only two operational E-8C&apos;s, thirteen more are scheduled to go into service before 2004. Boeing has repeatedly proposed moving the JSTARS system to a more capable airframe such as the 767-200, but the USAF and U.S. Army have rejected such requests on the basis of the cost-effectiveness of using venerated 707 bodies. However, as the remaining 707&apos;s continue to age, this fact may no longer apply, and such an upgrade may indeed happen in the near future.

		<DescriptionData>
The EA-6 has been the Navy&apos;s principle tactical Electronic Warfare (EW) aircraft since the Vietnam War. Based on the A-6 Intruder, the Prowler has received numerous avionics and airframe upgrades over the years. The Prowler&apos;s primary EW system is the AN/ALQ-99 Tactical jamming system which can jam several frequency bands on its own. The Prowler can carry up to five external jamming pods to extend its internal capabilities. AGM-88 HARM missiles and external fuel tanks can be carried in place of some of the pods.
                
Due to the cost of maintenance, the US Air Force has retired the EF-111 Raven in favor of the EA-6B. Since the Air Force hasn&apos;t actually procured its own, it will be dependent on Navy Prowlers for the foreseeable future. The Prowler has seen action in almost every US air-to-surface action, large and small, since the Vietnam War.

Description and Purpose:
The EA-18G Growler is a variant of the combat-proven F/A-18F Super Hornet Block II, and conducts Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) missions. The EA-18G combines the capability of the combat-proven Super Hornet with the latest AEA avionics suite evolved from the Improved Capability III (ICAP III) system. The EA-18G&apos;s vast array of sensors and weapons provides the warfighter with a lethal and survivable weapon system to counter current and emerging threats.
                
The AEA suite provides state-of-the-art selective-reactive and pre-emptive jamming capability. The majority of the AEA-unique avionics are installed on a pallet in the gun bay and in two wingtip pods. Nine weapon stations provide unique flexibility for carriage of weapons, jamming pods, and other stores to meet the needs for standoff jamming, escort jamming, time critical strike, or communications countermeasures. The AEA communications receiver and jamming system provide electronic suppression and attack against communication threats. These systems, combined with the F/A-18F Super Hornet air-to-air and air-to-ground capabilities, yield a formidable and flexible capability with significant growth capability for the future.
The EA-18G advanced cockpit combines with its onboard sensors and weapons to enable superior Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD) capability. The active electronically scanned array APG-79 AESA radar offers increased electronic warfare support and is capable of precision targeting utilizing cues from the ALQ-218 precision receiver system. Integrating these systems with advanced weapons yields a more formidable SEAD capability than previously possible.
                
Background:
The EA-18G Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) system was selected by the U.S. Navy to replace the EA-6B Prowler aircraft. Boeing and the U.S. Navy signed a five-year System Development and Demonstration contract on Dec. 29, 2003. Northrop Grumman is the major supplier to Boeing for the AEA subsystem. The SDD contract encompassed all laboratory, ground and flight tests from component level testing through full-up EA-18G weapons system performance flight testing. The program leverages proven processes developed by the Super Hornet program to provide a low-risk executable program, on schedule, under weight, and on cost ¡V the same best practices that enabled the Super Hornet to win the 1999 Collier Trophy, Department of Defense Acquisition Award, and the Aviation Week Program Excellence Award in 2005. The EA-18G has earned two awards to date: the 2006 David Packard Excellence in Acquisition Award and the 2007 Flight Award as the Defense Product of the Year.
                
The EA-18G&apos;s initial combat deployment occurred in late 2010 and concluded in mid-2011, supporting operations in Iraq and Libya.
                
Miscellaneous:
- The EA-18G Growler is based at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Wash.
- Boeing is currently delivering Super Hornets and Growlers to the U.S. Navy under a third multi-year contract through 2015.
- 21 Growlers were added to the 2014 budget, which is not part of the third multi-year contract. With these Growlers and the recent Australia announcement to procure 12 Growlers, production will continue through 2016.
                
Customer:
The EA-18G Growler is the U.S. Navy replacement for its current AEA aircraft, the EA-6B Prowler.
                
In May 2013, the Commonwealth of Australia announced its decision to further increase Australian Defence Force capabilities with the addition of 12 Growlers. Australia is the first country ever to be offered this level of Airborne Electronic Attack technology by the United States, which will give the Royal Australian Air Force unmatched abilities in the areas of electronic awareness and attack.

		<DescriptionData>
The EF-111A is an F-111A converted to an electronic warfare aircraft. While this jet has no weapons of its own, it nonetheless is a deadly threat to its enemies. The Raven can either be used to escort attack craft and jam anything that comes near them, or it can neutralize enemy radar. The EF-111A accomplishes these feats by using 10 ALQ-99E jammers, which also enable it to penetrate virtually any electronic defense. In air-to-air engagements, this craft is hardly defenseless. Its high speed makes it a tough target. During the Gulf War, an EF-111 was credited with a &quot;maneuver kill&quot; when an Iraqi aircraft crashed trying to pursue at low level. The EF-111A is being phased out of service in favor of the EA-6B.

Single seat version. Total of 371 F/A-18As for USN and USMC as escort fighters to replace F-4s and as attack aircraft replacing A-7s under FY79 to FY85 contracts;
November 1980; in service 7 January 1983 with Marine Fighter/Attack Squadron VMFA-314 at MCAS El Toro, California; first Navy squadron, VFA-113 of Pacific Fleet, October 1983; first Atlantic Fleet squadrons formed NAS Cecil Field, Florida, 1 February 1985; same month VFA-113 and VFA-25 embarked in USS Constellation.
At least 28 Navy Reserve aircraft upgraded to F/A-18A+ in Engineering Change Proposal 560 (ECP 560) programme during 1999, bringing them to a standard closely approximating that of the F/A-18C. Similar, but more elaborate, programme launched by US Marine Corps in FY00 budget, which featured request for funds to initiate Engineering Change Proposal 583 (ECP 583); project to begin with 24 F/A-18As and expected to total 76, in two active and four reserve squadrons. Work entails installation of AN/APG-73 radar and Rockwell Collins AN/ARC-210(V) UHF/VHF AM/FM jam-resistant radio suite, including Have Quick II, SINCGARS and MIDS Link 16 communications. Additional avionics changes concern provision of BAE Systems AN/APX-111(V) combined IFF interrogater/transponder, Smiths Industries AN/AYQ-9 stores management system, night vision display system, upgraded General Dynamics XN-8 mission computer and digital display indicator; upgraded aircraft able to employ newer sensors, such as Lockheed Martin AN/AAS-38B FLIR pod, and more capable weaponry, such as AIM-120 AMRAAM and JDAM.
ECP 583 also to be adopted by Canada at cost of more than C$900 million and may eventually be implemented by others that have yet to address issue of avionics upgrading.
                
These old Hornets are only to be found in the USN and Navy reserve.
Spain is still in the possesion of 91 F/A-18 A/B known to them as C.15 and CE.15.
                
In 1992, the original Hughes AN/APG-65 radar was replaced with the Hughes (now Raytheon) AN/APG-73, a faster and more capable radar. A-model Hornets that have been upgraded to the AN/APG-73 are designated F/A-18A+

The Eurofighter is a single-seat, twin-engine, agile combat aircraft which will be used in the Air-to-Air, Air-to-Ground and tactical reconnaissance roles. The design of the Eurofighter Typhoon is optimised for air dominance performance with high instantaneous and sustained turn rates and, especially, excess power. Particular emphasis has been placed on low wing loading, high thrust-to-weight ratio, excellent all-round vision and carefree handling. The use of stealth technology is incorporated throughout the aircraft&apos;s basic design.
In September 1998, the Eurofighter was also designated the Typhoon, though this nomenclature is intended only for use in export markets outside Europe. &quot;Typhoon&quot; will not automatically be the EF2000&apos;s name within the four partner air forces when it enters service in 2002/2003.

The F-4D was an improved version of the F-4C which was better suited to the specific requirements of the Tactical Air Command. Although it was externally almost identical to the F-4C which preceded it in U.S.A.F. service, it was very different internally.
The F-4D was authorized in March of 1964, and the first example flew on December 7, 1965. Deliveries began in March of 1966. The first deliveries were to the 36th Tactical Fighter Wing based at Bitburg in Germany. It was later followed by the 4th TFW based at Seymour Johnson AFB in North Carolina in January of 1967. A total of 793 F-4Ds were built for the U.S.A.F.
The F-4D had the same engines and basic airframe as the F-4C, and had the same internal fuel tankage as that of the RF-4C. The major difference was in the avionics. The most significant change was the replacement of the APQ-100 radar of the F-4C by the smaller and lighter partly solid-state AN/APQ-109A. This was part of the AN/APA-165 radar set which introduced an air-to-ground ranging mode using movable cursors. The F-4Ds fitted with the AN/APQ-109A radar set could be externally distinguished from the F-4C by the presence of a larger radome. However, some F-4Ds were fitted with the AN/APA-157 radar set group similar to that fitted to the F-4C and were hence externally identical to the F-4C.
The undernose pod for the AAA-4 infrared search and track was removed. The Collins ASQ-19 miniaturized communication/navigation/identification suite became standard. The Litton ASN-48 inertial navigation system of the F-4C was replaced by an ASN-63 set, which was upgraded and made lighter in weight. An AJB-7 all-altitude bomb delivery system was provided, which was connected to an ASQ-91 weapons release computer for delivery of laser-guided bombs.
Starting with Block 27, the infrared search and track pod under the radome was reinstalled, but not to house the AAA-4 infrared search and track, but rather to carry the forward amplifier and antenna of the ALR-25/26 radar warning system. Later, this system was replaced by the APS-107A with fin antennae and the ALR-69(V)2 with antennae in the chin pod.
Externally-hung jammers that could be carried included the ALQ-87 FM barrage jammer, the Westinghouse ALQ-101 noise/deception jammer, and the Westinghouse ALQ-119 noise/deception jammer capable of covering three bands.
A multiple ejector rack was provided for the centerline pylon and triple ejector racks were provided for the inboard underwing pylon.
The weapons system officer in the back seat was often given a TV display fed from the seeker of a homing bomb system, initially for the GBU-8 and later for the GBU-15.
For weapons aiming, the F-4C had relied on a fixed sight and a simple chart on which it the image of the target was projected. The operation of this system made accurate bombing very difficult. The F-4D had improved avionics to increase the accuracy of its air-to-ground weapons. These included an AN/ASQ-91 weapons release computer system. This system measured various aircraft parameters such as speed, attitude, and climbing rate, and combined it with radar data on the slant range to the target to tell the bomb when to drop from the aircraft.
Also fitted was an AN/ASG-22 lead computing optical sight with amplifier and gyro. This system was designed to improve the effectiveness of the Phantom in air-to-air combat. The system combined information about speed, air density and angle of attack, and combined it with radar data about the velocity, direction and distance of the target to compute the lead angle needed to score a hit.
From the spring of 1967, the F-4D gradually began to replace the earlier F-4C in combat in Vietnam. It initially appeared over Vietnam with the 8th TFW, commanded by Lt. Col. Robin Olds. The first F-4D MiG kill took place on June 5, 1967, when crewmen Maj. Everett T. Raspberry and Capt. Francis Gullick shot down a MiG-17 near Hanoi. The F-4D eventually destroyed 45 enemy aircraft, and the U.S.A.F.&apos;s three Vietnam-era aces got their fifth kills in F-4Ds during the Linebacker campaign of 1972. Captain Steve Ritchie of the 432nd TFW got his fifth kill in F-4D number 66-0167 on August 18, 1972.
In later years, the absence of an internal cannon was seen as a liability in close-in air-to-air combat. The F-4D could carry an external centerline SUU-23 pod containing an M-61A1 cannon, but it was bulky, provided lots of drag which seriously compromised performance, and was rather inaccurate to boot. In addition, the cannon pod took up valuable real estate underneath the fuselage, markedly reducing the offensive load that could be carried.
The Westinghouse AN/ASQ-152(V)-2 Pave Spike laser target designator was fitted to several F-4Ds. The cylindrical Pave Spike laser designator pod was mounted inside one of the Sparrow missile wells on the fuselage underside. The system used television optics, which made it daylight-capable only. Those Pave Spike aircraft which had the capability of launching the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-surface missile included 66-7509, 7531, 7546, 7634, 7661, 7722, 7746, 8819, and 8821.
The AN/AVQ-10 Pave Knife laser target designator could be carried on the inboard underwing pylon of specially modified F-4Ds. This pod had a stabilized head housing a boresighted TV camera and laser designator. It had a low-light television system, which made nighttime missions theoretically possible, although it is not certain that this was ever done. Attempts were made to slave the pod&apos;s optics to the aircraft radar, but these were not successful. The system operated by having the pod look in the same direction as the pilot&apos;s bomb sight, with the weapons system officer then finding the target on his monitor screen as the pilot pointed his aircraft at it. Pave Knife aircraft included 66-7652, 7674, 7675, 7679, 7681, 7707, 7709, 7743, 7760, 7766, and 7773. Combat missions with the Pave Knife began on May 23, 1968, initially in conjunction with the GBU-10/B laser-guided bomb. All Pave Knife aircraft were assigned to the 433rd TFS of the 8th TFW. Perhaps the most spectacular use of the Pave Knife was the dropping of a span of the Paul Doumer Bridge near Hanoi on May 10, 1972. This bridge had survived literally hundreds of previous attacks.
Two F-4Ds (66-8738 and 66-8812) were fitted with the AVQ-11 Pave Sword precision attack sensor. This consisted of a modified AIM-9 Sidewinder seeker head as a laser spot tracker for targets designated by AVQ-12 Pave Spot laser designators carried by O-2As. The system was mounted inside a modified SUU-11 gun pod that was suspended from the right-forward Sparrow well or from the right inboard underwing pylon.
The AVQ-9 Pave Light laser designator was fitted to 65-0597, 0609, 0612, 0642, 0677, 0706, 0786, 66-8814, 8815, 8817, and 8823. This designator was mounted on the left side of the rear canopy frame of the F-4D. In order to use the system, the pilot had to fly in a left turn around the target and shine the laser while other aircraft attacked it. If an emergency escape proved to be necessary, the WSO first had to demount and store the designator before he could safely eject. Aircraft fitted with the Pave Light system were assigned to the 8th TFW.
The Combat Tree modification of 1968-69 permitted the retention of a full missile load while carrying electronic countermeasures gear. It did this by adding an attachment point for a countermeasures pod on the inboard pylon, which could now carry two more AIM-9J Sidewinder missiles on each side.
Under the Pave Arrow program, two F-4Ds were equipped with a Sidewinder infrared seeker mounted in a fixed pod for locating heat sources from ground targets.
The designation EF-4D was given to four F-4Ds modified for the Wild Weasel IV/V SAM suppression role. 65-0657 and 65-0660 were fitted with the AN/APS-107 radar homing and warning system and a target acquisition system for AGM-78 Standard anti-radiation missiles. 66-7635 and 66-7647 served as test beds for the AN/APS-38 warning and attack system developed by McDonnell Douglas and later adopted for the F-4G.

The Phantom II, originally designed for fleet defense for the U.S. Navy, entered service in 1961. Less than a year later the F-4C was approved for the U.S. Air Force. Throughout the 1960&apos;s and 1970&apos;s USAF Phantom II&apos;s executed ground-attack, reconnaissance, and SEAD missions, particularily in the Vietnam War.At°
                
In 1973 the USAF received its first shipment of F-4E&apos;s. The upgraded aircraft included target-acquisition equipment designed for visual identification of distant targets, and the Pave Track system, a target-designation system for AGM-65 Mavericks and other laser- or optically-guided missiles. The F-4E also included an enhanced digital navigation system to replace the outdated INS, as well as an intercept computer that calculated dynamic launch zones for the AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow.
                
The F-4 lived out the remainder of its lifespan as the F-4G &quot;Wild Weasel&quot;, a specialized model intended for SEAD profiles. The F-4G eschewed its 20mm cannon for a portfolio of electronic warfare equipment. During Desert Storm, F-4G&apos;s, in concert with F-16C&apos;s, effectively suppressed enemy radar sites. The last F-4&apos;s were removed from the U.S. inventory in December of 1995.

The F-4EJ was a version of the F-4E developed for the Nihon Koku Jieitai (Japanese Air Self Defense Force, or JASDF).
                            
Since the Japanese armed forces were at that time forbidden by treaty from having even a hint of an offensive capability, the F-4EJ was optimized for the air defense role, the AN/ASQ-9A nuclear weapon control system, the AN/ARW-77 Bullpup ASM control system, the AN/ASQ-91 weapons delivery system, and the AN/AJB-7 bombing system all being omitted. There was no provision for the carrying or delivery of air-to-ground weapons. Aerial refuelling was limited to use in ground refuelling ports only.

The F-4F was a version of the USAF F-4E built explicitly for the West German Luftwaffe. After having considered the Dassault Mirage F.1, the Lockheed CL-1200 Lancer, and even a single-seat fighter version of the Phantom under the designation F-4E(F), the Luftwaffe opted for 175 two-seat F-4Fs. The F-4F emerged as a lighter and simpler F-4E which was significantly cheaper and incorporated major components that were manufactured in Germany.
With the ICE/KWS (Improved Combat Efficeny / Kampfwertsteigerung) program beginning in 1983, the simplified AN/APQ-120 radar of the F-4F was to be replaced with the highly-capable Hughes APG-65 digital multimode radar. The F-4F was also to be given the capability of carrying and launching the Hughes AIM-120 AMRAAM missile.
Further upgrades included a new Litef digital fire control computer, a TST radar control console, and Frazer-Nash ejectors for the belly-mounted AMRAAMS. Also to be provided were a new IFF system, a new air data computer, and a new intertial platform.

The F-4G was the designation applied to 116 U.S.A.F. F-4Es which were converted to the Wild Weasel anti-SAM configuration. These aircraft should not be confused with the Navy F-4G which was the designation applied to twelve F-4Bs that were fitted with automatic carrier landing systems.
Throughout the late 1960s, the Wild Weasel III adaptation of the F-105F two-seat Thunderchief had been the primary anti-SAM attack aircraft in Vietnam. However, by 1970, the F-105 airframe was no longer in production, and attrition in Vietnam had made it a scarce resource. The need for a replacement for the F-105F Wild Weasel had become apparent. 36 F-4C airframes had been converted to the EF-4C Wild Weasel IV configuration, but they suffered from certain deficiencies which limited their combat effectiveness. For example, they were unable to carry the Standard ARM. Consequently, the EF-4C was seen only as an interim Wild Weasel aircraft, pending the introduction of a more suitable type.
McDonnell and the U.S.A.F. both agreed that the more capacious airframe of the F-4E would be able to carry the electronics for the more capable AGM-78 Standard anti-radiation missile. A YF-4E (65-0713) was fitted with a mockup installation of the AN/APR-38 radar warning and attack system, and the results were sufficiently satisfactory, so that the decision was made to convert 116 low-time F-4E airframes for the anti-SAM role. The code name &quot;Wild Weasel V&quot; was assigned to the project.
Several EF-4Ds and F-4Es were used in support of the program. F-4E 69-7254 served as the YF-4G prototype, although it was originally known as the F-4E Advanced Wild Weasel. This F-4G was fitted with leading-edge maneuvering slats. The M61A1 cannon and ammunition drum were removed and replaced by an under-nose fairing that housed forward- and side-looking radar antennae and line replacement units for the AN/APR-38 radar warning and attack system. This system can be reprogrammed at squadron level, can identify known enemy air-defense radar systems and display their locations in a predetermined order of priority. The under-nose fairing has a ram inlet that admits cooling air to the interior, which helps to cool the avionics systems inside the nose.
There are a total of 52 receiving and emitting antenna found all over the aircraft. The main receivers are housed in front of the chin gondola that replaced the gun, with others being housed in a pod mounted on top of the fin. Eight of the blade antennae that protrude from the fuselage provide low-band omnidirectional signal reception, with five others being directional and capable of giving the threat bearing on the display in the rear cockpit.
Boxes for dispensing chaff or flare cartridges can be attached to the sides of the underwing pylons. The usual pattern is the Tracor ALE-40, with 30 tubes firing aft.
             
The backseat crew member has three main displays: a plan-position indicator, a panoramic analysis display, and a homing indicator. The plan-position indicator is duplicated on the pilot&apos;s control panel. The plan-position indicator gives the range and bearing of each threat that is identified by the system. The type of each threat is then designated on the display, and the threat deemed by the system to be the most dangerous is identified by having a bright triangle superimposed over it.
In support of its mission, the F-4G could carry the AGM-45 Shrike and the AGM-78 Standard anti-radiation missiles.
The General Dynamics AGM-78 Standard anti-radiation missile was an attempt to correct some of the deficiencies of the Shrike. It had a longer range and a larger warhead than the Shrike. The AGM-78 was based on the Standard RIM-66A ship-to-air missile. It has a launch weight of about 1,400 pounds and carries a 215-pound warhead. Maximum range was about 35 miles. The missile flies on a dual-thrust rocket motor and steers with tail controls and very low-aspect ratio fixed wings. The Standard ARM first appeared in service in 1968. The first version of the Standard had the simple Shrike seeker, but later versions had the Maxson broadband radiation seeker and memory circuits to deal with radar shutdown tactics.
In addition, the F-4G could carry the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missile, which existed in both TV-guided and imaging infrared versions. It could also carry the Mk 84 electro-optical glide bomb, the homing bomb system, and cluster weapons such as the Rockeye, CBU-52, and CBU-58.
In later years, the Texas Instruments AGM-88 High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) superseded most of the former weapons, offering a greatly enhanced kill capability and greater launch versatility. It was designed to provide much higher speeds and much quicker target acquisition times so that radars could be destroyed before they had a chance to be switched off or take other sorts of evasive actions. The HARM has a launch weight of about 800 pounds and has an effective range of about 17 miles. The warhead of the HARM is of a fragmentation variety, which destroys the target by producing a deadly shower of steel cubes. I don&apos;t know the weight of the warhead - presumably this is classified information. There are three basic modes of operation for the HARM: Self Protect, Target of Opportunity, and Pre-Briefed. In the Self-Protect mode, the launching aircraft&apos;s systems detect the threat and assign its priority. The aircraft&apos;s on-board computers then sort the data and pass along to the HARM&apos;s computer a set of digital instructions needed to reach the target, and the missile is then launched. The HARM can continue to fly toward the target even if the enemy radar is switched off. In the Target of Opportunity mode, the HARM&apos;s sensitive seeker is used to help to determine when to launch against a previously unknown threat. In the Pre-Briefed mode, the HARM can be programmed on the ground for up to three known types of enemy radar emissions. Once in the air, the launching aircraft can fire the HARM blind in the general direction of these known enemy radar emitters. If they are silent, the HARM will self-destruct, but if an enemy site begins to radiate, the HARM will automatically home in on it. Test flights of the HARM began in 1976, and deployment began in early 1983. Earlier versions of the HARM had to be sent back to a depot in the U.S. for reprogramming, but later versions can be reprogrammed on the flight line.
For self-protection, the F-4G could carry up to four AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles on the sides of the inboard underwing pylons. In addition, four AIM-7 Sparrows could be carried in the underfuselage slots. However, the left front slot was often taken up by the installation of an ALQ-119 or ALQ-141 jammer pod.
All of the F-4Gs were rebuilds of Block 42 to 45 F-4Es. The first of these aircraft (69-7254) was modified by McDonnell and began flight trials in December of 1975. Subsequent F-4G aircraft were modified by the Air Force at Hill AFB in Utah. The last modification was completed in 1981.
The first F-4Gs went to the 39th TFTS of the 35th TFW, based at George AFB in California in April of 1978. In 1981, the F-4Gs of the 35th TFW were turned over to the 37th TFW, also based at George. In 1989, the 37th TFW was transferred to Tonopah, Nevada to take over the operation of the F-117, and turned their F-4Gs back over to the 35th TFW.
              
In 1979, F-4Gs were issued to the 52nd TFW based at Spangdahlem AFB in Germany. In the same year, F-4Gs were assigned to the 90th TFS of the 3rd TFW based at Clark AFB in the Philippines.
A two-part Performance Update Program (PUP) was undertaken in the mid-1980s. The first phase was the expansion of the capability of the on-board computer by adding a new Unisys CP-1674 digital processor. The second phase was the upgrading of the APR-38 to APR-47 standards.
By the time of Desert Shield, the F-4G equipped two squadrons of the 35th TFW, the 561st TFS and the 562nd TFTS.
Following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on August 2, 1990, the 561st TFS (part of the 35th TFW based at George AFB) deployed to the Middle East as a part of Desert Shield. Twenty-four F-4Gs were deployed. They were configured with three external fuel tanks (one on the centerline and two underneath the outboard underwing pylons), four chaff/flare dispensers, two AGM-88 HARM missiles on the inboard pylons, and three AIM-7M Sparrow missiles and an ALQ-184 electronic countermeasures pod in the four missile slots.
At the time of Desert Storm, the F-4G was still the only Wild Weasel aircraft available to the U.S.A.F. The F-4Gs of the 35th TFW played an important part in Operation Desert Storm in 1991, when they cut a path through Iraqi air defenses during the initial attack on January 17. The F-4Gs of the 52nd TFW based at Spangdahlem in Germany were also added to the assets of the 35th TFW based at Sheik Isa AFB in Bahrain and to the 7440th Composite Wing based at Incirlik AFB in Turkey. During the war, only one F-4G was lost. It was 69-7571, which crashed on January 18, 1991. It was not actually lost as the result of any enemy action, but because it simply ran out of gas. Coming back from a target it missed the orbit of the tanker it was to refuel from. There was not enough fuel to fly past the tanker and then circle back to line up for refueling, so the pilot decided to land at Al Kharj Airbase, Saudi Arabia. As luck would have it, heavy earth moving equipment had accidentally cut the runway landing lights and the base was covered in fog. The F-4G was right over the runway, made several passes but couldn&apos;t see it. So, the crew members ejected and 7571 bellied in. After the crash, the plane still looked surprisingly good, which attested to the robustness of the design.
The F-4G was the last version of the Phantom to remain in front-line service with the U.S.A.F. Following Desert Storm and the general defense drawdown after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, many U.S.A.F. F-4Gs were turned over to the Air National Guard. On April 12, 1991, the Department of Defense announced that the F-4Gs would all be reassigned to ANG units. Under this plan, the 90th FS at Clark AB in the Philippines was scheduled to convert from F-4E/Gs to F-15Es and move to Alaska. The 35th FW at George AFB in California was to be inactivated, and the 52nd FW at Spangdahlem AB in Germany was to lose all of its F-4Gs. The F-4Gs were to be transferred to the Idaho and Kentucky ANG.
The 190th TRS of the Idaho ANG began its conversion from the RF-4C to the F-4G in June of 1991. Another RF-4C ANG unit, the 192nd TRS of the Nevada ANG, had been scheduled to convert to the F-4G (and had even painted F-4G 69-7580 in its distinctive &quot;High Rollers&quot; insignia), but the Defense Department changed its mind in April of 1991, and the Idaho ANG was to be the only ANG unit to operate the F-4G.
Combat experience during Desert Storm indicated that the phase-out of the F-4G was premature, and a new active duty squadron, the 561st FS of the 57th FW, was activated at Nellis AFB. The parent unit of the 561st was redesignated 57th Wing in April 1993.
The 81st TFS, 52nd FW at Spangdahlem in Germany continued throughout 1993 to deploy to Incirlik in Turkey in support of Operation Provide Comfort, the enforcement of the no-fly zone over northern Iraq. These F-4Gs returned to Germany at the end of 1993. However, the need for Wild Weasels to support Operation Southern Watch in Saudi Arabia and Operation Provide Comfort in Turkey resulted in the 52nd FW retaining a few F-4Gs until February 1994. The 81st TFS returned their last F-4Gs to the USA on March 18, 1994. These planes were the last U.S.-operated Phantoms to be based in Europe.
In April 1993, the 124th FW of the Idaho ANG took over this responsibility and was assigned to active duty in Saudi Arabia to support Operation Southern Watch, the enforcement of the no-fly zone over southern Iraq. One of the ANG F-4Gs had to fire an AGM-88 HARM missile in response to a threatening Iraqi radar site near Basra. The Idaho ANG F-4Gs were later transferred to Incirlik AB in Turkey to support Operation Provide Comfort II. Overall, there were a total of four deployments to the Gulf. The last such deployment returned to the USA in December of 1995.
The F-4G was replaced by the F-16 in its Wild Weasel role. The last active U.S.A.F. F-4G squadron, the 561st Fighter Squadron, was inactivated at Nellis AFB in March of 1996 and its planes placed in storage. On April 20, 1996, the last F-4Gs were withdrawn by the 124th FW of the Idaho ANG and were consigned to the boneyards at Davis Monthan AFB. This marked the final departure of the Phantom from active service with any American unit.
In 1991, it was decided that those F-4Gs not transferred to the ANG or placed in storage would be converted into drones under the designation QF-4G. Tracor Flight Systems of Austin, Texas was to do the conversion work. The company reportedly had gotten F-4Gs 69-7261, 69-7301, and 69-7263 for the initial conversion work. Following the conversion of 7301 and 7261, the droning program was halted, at least temporarily. 7301 crashed on May 14, 1993, killing its Tracor civilian crew.

First flight May 1954 and born in the era after the Korean Conflict when pilots were calling for lighter, simpler fighters with high performance. In 62 the DoD decided to buy large numbers of these aircraft to give or sell to anti-communist nations. A total amount of 636 planes have been produced, until June ´72. The USAF version is used for pilot training and is called the Talon with over 1200 being produced.

The Tiger II is an incredibly agile light fighter. The design of the aircraft deliberately sacrificed speed in exchange for some of this maneuverability. Because of its twin engine design and small fuel capacity the aircraft suffers from short legs. The avionics suite is also rudimentary. On the other hand, the F-5 is less expensive than its larger brethren, so while it hasn&apos;t found a home in U.S.A.F. hangars, it has sold very well overseas. The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps use a small number of F-5s in training to simulate combat with smaller, more agile MiGs.
         
In 1970, Northrop won the International Fighter Aircraft (IFA) competition to replace the F-5A, with better air-to-air performance against aircraft like the Soviet MiG-21. The resultant aircraft, initially known as F-5A-21, subsequently became the F-5E. It had more powerful (5,000 lbf) General Electric J85-21 engines, and had a lengthened and enlarged fuselage, accommodating more fuel. Its wings were fitted with enlarged leading edge extensions, giving an increased wing area and improved maneuverability. The aircraft's avionics were more sophisticated, crucially including a radar (initially the Emerson Electric AN/APQ-153) (the F-5A and B had no radar). It retained the gun armament of two M39 cannons, one on either side of the nose of the F-5A. Various specific avionics fits could be accommodated at a customer's request, including an inertial navigation system, TACAN and ECM equipment.

A dedicated air-to-air fighter, the Tomcat is extremely fast and packs the best air-to-air weaponry and electronics on any carrier deck. Its Hughes AWG-9 radar system can track 24 targets and engage 6 simultaneously, and its AIM-54 Phoenix radar-guided missile can lock and home from more than 75 nautical miles away. The F-14A is fairly agile close in, but its true strength lies in the immense range at which it can engage. 
           
Its variable-sweep wing allows wide variation in speeds. The unswept wingspan is 64 ft, 1.5 in. The F-14A was built for air-to-air combat and does that very well; most opponents will find themselves hunted by the Tomcat&apos;s missiles long before they get close to the Tomcat. Only Iran and the United States possess the Tomcat. None of Iran&apos;s Tomcats are believed to be flying due to a lack of spare parts.

Known as F-14A(Plus) until 1 May 1991; second use of F-14B designation; interim improved version re-engined with GE F110-GE-400 turbofans pending introduction of F-14D (see below). Development began July 1984; Grumman prime contractor with General Electric as subcontractor. F110 has 82 per cent parts commonality with F110-GE-100 in USAF F-15s and F-16s; 1.27 m (4 ft 2 in) plug inserted in afterburner section to match engine to F-14A inlet position and airframe contours; only secondary structure requires modification; new engine allows unrestricted throttle handling throughout flight envelope and eliminates compressor stalls. NASA scoops for Vulcan cannon; glove vanes eliminated; cockpit modified. Full-scale development used two aircraft, including (first use) F-14B prototype (157986), which made first flight with definitive F110-GE-400 engines 29 September 1986; second prototype was upgraded to full F-14D configuration.
F-14B followed F-14A into production; first flight production F-14B (162910) 14 November 1987; 18, 15 and five funded in FY86-88; first delivery, to VF-101, 11 April 1988; IOC with two US Navy squadrons achieved early 1989; F-14B production deliveries (last aircraft 163411) completed May 1990. Initially, 32 F-14As upgraded to F-14B. Further 15 conversions funded (US$143 million) in FY92; Grumman to build conversion kits, then compete with Norfolk naval depot for installation contract; FY93 funds of US$175 million for installations. B variant issued to VF-24, 74, 101, 103, 142, 143 and 211.
              
It was retired the 22 September 2006, maching the day with the intruduction day 22 september 1974
Difference in types (B and D) mostly engine and avionics.

The F-14D designation had originally been assigned to a cost-reduced, stripped version of the Tomcat, proposed at a time when the rapidly-increasing cost of the F-14A was causing great concern. This project never achieved fruition.
The F-14D that is known today originated back in 1984 as an with the F-14A(Plus). advanced Tomcat derivative that was to be developed in parallel
The USN plans to remove these from service in 2007.

The F-15A was the first production version of the Eagle. There was no XF-15, since the aircraft had been ordered &quot;off the drawing board&quot;, with no prototypes being built. A total of 384 single-seat F-15A were built, including 18 Full-Scale Development (FSD) aircraft. The -15A is more limited in its weapon selection than the more modern -15C.

The F-15C was the next major single-seat version of the Eagle.
Externally, it was virtually identical to the F-15A which preceded it, but internally there were a number of significant differences that made it a much more capable fighter aircraft.
The only external difference between the F-15A and the F-15C was the introduction on the F-15C of the capability of carrying FAST (Fuel And Sensor Tactical) packs attached to the side of the fuselage outside of each air intake. The tanks conform to the aerodynamic shape of the side of the fuselage, and when they are installed, there is very little adverse aerodynamic effect and very little degradation in performance. When the FAST packs are removed, the F-15C is externally indistinguishable from the F-15A, and the two variants can be distinguished only by a knowledge of their serial numbers. However, on the F-15C, the FAST packs are only very rarely actually taken off the aircraft. The FAST packs are now referred to as Conformal Fuel Tanks (CFTs).
                
The Multi-Stage Improvement Program (MSIP) is a joint program carried out by McDonnell Douglas and the USAF&apos;s Warner Robins Logistics Center in Georgia. Under MSIP, upgrades were progressively incorporated onto the production line and then retrofitted to earlier production aircraft. MSIP II is that portion of the program which handles the F-15C/D.
The Electronic Warfare Warning Set (EWWS) was modified into the more capable Tactical Electronic Warfare System (TEWS) with an ALQ-135 electronic countermeasures set and an upgraded ALR-56C radar warning receiver. An overload warning system was provided to prevent pilots from accidentally exceeding 9g during combat maneuvering.
The F-15C/D aircraft going through the MSIP II were fitted with the wiring needed to give them the capability of carrying and launching the AIM-120 AMRAAM missile, which was introduced into service in the early 1990s.

The F-15D is the two-seat version of the F-15C. A total of 61 F-15Ds were built for the USAF, eight for Israel, 12 for Japan (as F-15DJs), and 16 for Saudi Arabia. The F-15D is dimensionally identical to the F-15C, and carries the same electronics suite suite and armament fit. It has essentially the same performance as well.
However, the F-15D does not have any provision for the internal ALQ-135 ECM system.

The F-15E is a two-seat, ground-attack variant of the Eagle. The E-model incorporates several improvements in avionics and structure and carries an increased payload of 24,500 lbs. While the F-15E retains a capable air-to-air threat, the aircraft&apos;s agility is reduced by its additional weight, especially when it is carrying a load of bombs.
In Operation Desert Storm, 48 F-15Es flew more than 2,200 sorties. The two squadrons committed to the conflict flew 40-60 sorties per night, each sortie averaging 3.27 hours in length. Two of the F-15Es were shot down.

The F-15I is operated by the Israeli Air Force where it is known as the Ra&apos;am (&quot;Thunder&quot;). It is a dual-seat ground attack aircraft powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney F100-PW-229 engines, and is based on the F-15E.
                
The F-15I Ra&apos;am is similar to the F-15E, but features several different avionic systems to meet Israeli requirements. To facilitate night-time strikes, the F-15Is were initially fitted with Sharpshooter targeting pods designed for Israeli F-16s. The Sharpshooter pod was less capable than the LANTIRN pods used on USAF F-15Es; Israel later purchased 30 LANTIRN pods. The F-15Is initially lacked Radar Warning Receivers, Israel installed its own electronic warfare equipment, the Elisra SPS-2110, as well as a new central computer and embedded GPS/INS system. All sensors can be slaved to the Display And Sight Helmet (DASH) helmet-mounted sight, providing both crew members a means of targeting which the F-15E lacks. The F-15I uses the APG-70I radar; its terrain mapping capability can locate targets difficult to spot while under adverse weather conditions. The radar can detect large airliner-sized targets at 150 nautical miles, and fighter-sized targets at 56 nautical miles, it has a reduced resolution one-third below the standard USAF APG-70.

So far, the only nation to build the F-15 Eagle under license is Japan. In June-July of 1975, Japanese officers carried out two flight evaluations of the F-15A/B Eagle at Edwards AFB. In December of 1977, the Japanese National Defense Council announced that the Eagle had been selected to supplement and eventually replace the Lockheed F-104J Starfighters serving with the Nihon Koku Jietai (Japanese Air Self Defense Force, or JASDF). The Japanese Eagle was to be designated F-15J, with the two-seat version being F-15DJ. They were to be the Japanese counterparts of the F-15A and B respectively.
                
As it turned out, the Japanese F-15s were quite similar to the early production blocks of the USAF F-15C and D. However, Japanese Eagles were to differ from the Air Force Eagles primarily in omitting certain sensitive items of electronic countermeasures equipment, such as the ICS and EWWS sets. In their place, provisions were made for the installation of a Japanese-built radar warning system.

The F-15K Slam Eagle is a combat-proven multirole fighter with unmatched capabilities in speed, range, payload and persistence.
                
The F-15K is an advanced variant of the combat-proven F-15E. Equipped with the latest technological upgrades, it is more capable, survivable, and maintainable than its predecessor. The F-15K enables the Republic of Korea (ROK) to change its focus from the short range defense of the past half-century to a broader regional view that considers the omnidirectional threats it will face in the 21st century. The F-15K service life is planned through 2040 and beyond, with technology insertions and upgrades throughout the lifecycle.
o Maximum gross takeoff weight of 81,000 pounds (36,740 kg) with a payload capability of 29,100 pounds (13,222 kg)
o Maximum combat radius without refueling: more than 1,000 nautical miles (1,800 kg)
o Minimum altitude and maximum speed of terrain-following flight: 600 knots at 100 feet (30.48m)
o Power:
o F-15 Next Fighter I Program: two General Electric
F110-GE-129 (29,000 lb (131 kN) thrust class) engines
o F-15 Next Fighter II Program: two Pratt &amp; Whitney
F-100-PW-229 (29,000 lb (131kN) thrust class) engines

A state-of-the-art cockpit and advanced avionics combined with the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) results in increased situational awareness and enhanced air-to-air and self-defense capabilities.
                
o The F-15K&apos;s AN/APG-63(V)1 radar incorporates all air-to-air and air-to-ground modes of the APG-70 and adds ground moving target track, sea surface search and track.
o The newest generation Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) system enhances target detection and tracking.
o Link 16 Fighter Data Link connects the F-15K to the networked battlefield.
o Improved self-protection capability through the ALQ-135M.
o The Infra-Red Search and Track (IRST) system provides enhanced passive detection and tracking of airborne targets.
                
Unmatched Combat Radius
                
The F-15K operates with a combat radius/endurance of nearly 1,800 kilometers (more than 1,000 nm) - more than 200 kilometers greater than any competitor&apos;s aircraft.
                
Unmatched Speed
                
With a top speed of Mach 2.5, the F-15K offers unmatched climbing and closing speeds.
                
Unmatched Maximum Payload
                
The F-15K carries a greater variety of weapons and a larger payload - more than 13,403 kilograms (29,500 pounds) to ensure a true multirole capability.
                
Computer and Targeting Systems
The F-15K includes an advanced computer, displays, and protection and targeting systems:
                
o Avionics suite: Honeywell advanced display core processor (ADCP)
o Cockpit-display technologies: seven-color liquid-crystal displays, two upfront control panels (flat-panel), JHMCS, and a wide-field-of-view head-up display
o Onboard protection systems: BAE Systems ALR-56C(V)1 early warning receiver and Northrop Grumman ALQ-135M jammer and the ALE-47(V)1 Countermeasures set
o Third-generation targeting and navigation systems: FLIR and IRST.
                
In April 2002, the ROK awarded Boeing a contract for 40 F-15K aircraft, all of which were delivered to ROK Air Force ahead of schedule and on cost. The ROK awarded Boeing a second contract for 21 F-15K aircraft in April 2008 under its Next Fighter II (NF II) requirement. All 21 F-15K aircraft under the Next Fighter II requirement were delivered on schedule and on cost. The final F-15K was delivered April 2, 2012 .

In the mid 1980s, faced with an improving Soviet threat, numerous European F-16A/B Block 15 aircraft were scheduled to go through a Mid-Life Update (MLU) program. The MLU program was designed to bring the Block 15 aircraft up to the standards of the Block 50/52 F-16C/D, in particular to give them the capability of carrying and launching BVR weapons such as the AIM-120 AMRAAM, together with the ability to carry out precision weapons delivery missions at night and in adverse weather. Upgardes consist of a new radar set, GPS, Wide angle HUD, Block50/52 type cockpit with colours MFD, Night vision goggle compatibility, a modular mission computer, digital terrain system.
The international MLU agreement was signed on May 3, 1991, with the USA, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway all being participants. The USA had originally planned to upgrade some of its F-16A/Bs as part of the MLU program, but because of the end of the Cold War and the general reduction in the US fighter force, it withdrew from the program in 1992, but agreed to continue to support the MLU and to carry out test flying for development. The European MLU pact had to be revised downward to reflect the new fiscal constraints arising from the end of the Cold War.
General Dynamics (now Lockheed Fort Worth) was awarded a contract to build the MLU kits. One F-16 from each of the USAF, Danish, Dutch, and Norwegian air forces was delivered to Lockheed Forth Worth in September 1992 to act as a prototype for conversion under the MLU program.
The MLU aircraft are all re-equipped with the Northrop Grumman AN/APG-66(V)2 radar. This more advanced unit has an improved transmitter and low-power RF section, and a new signal data processor. The system has a 25-percent longer range, and can cary out multiple missile engagements. It is compatable with BVR missiles such as SkyFlash, AIM-7 and MICA as well as the AMRAAM.
The three computers of the original F-16 (the fire-control computer, the stores management computer, and the HUD controller) are replaced by a single Texas Instruments (now Raytheon) modular mission computer.
The gauge cockpit instruments are replaced by electronic instruments using full-color LCD displays. The original HUD is replaced by a wide-angle GEC-Marconi unit similar to that fitted to the Block 50/52 F-16C/D. The cockpit and display generator are compatible with night-vision goggles. The cockpit and display generator also have provisions for helmet-mounted displays, but HMD technology is not incorporated into the system itself.
The MLU carries the Hazeltine AXP-113(V) IFF system, with a quadruple set of interrogator antenna mounted ahead of the windshield. This system is not carried in USAF F-16Cs.
             
A fully-integrated Global Positioning System (GPS) is installed, and a digital terrain system (DTS) is fitted. The DTS is built into the OSC/Fairchild Defense Data Transfer Unit (DTU). The DTU allows the pilot to load mission data into the system via a plug-in cartridge. The DTU cartridge has a processor which incorporates a terrain profile matching algorithm. DTS determines the exact position of the fighter by matching the changing radar altimeter readings to the terrain profiles stored in the database. DTS provides terrain-following information to the HUD, and DTS data provides the aircraft&apos;s pilot with a waring if the aircraft is in any danger of striking an obstacle. GPS and INS provide two independent check on the health of the DTS. The DTS also provides passive ranging to ground targets.
The MLU also provides chin pylons for FLIR and targeting pods. The basic MLU does not provide an active onboard electronic warfare system, but the Terma EW system can support active jamming and missile approach warning systems.
The first MLU aircraft flew in April of 1995. By early 1998, conversions were being carried out in all four countries. Present plans are for 48 Belgian, 61 Danish, 156 Dutch, and 56 Norwegian F-16A/Bs to go through the MLU program. The program is scheduled to continue into 2003.
Belgium 90, Netherlands 138, Danmark 69 and Norway 48 are rebuilding there AC into F-16AM/BM (MLU).
F-16A/B : Portugal 40, Italy ordered 34 (2003), USAF, USAFRes, ANG.
The USN orderded 14.

The General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon is one of most significant fighters of the latter part of the 20th century. It was originally developed from a concept for an experimental lightweight fighter and has evolved into an all-weather fighter and precision attack aircraft. The F-16 has been manufactured on as many as five separate production lines, making it the largest fighter program in the Western world. Over 4000 F-16s have been built. The F-16A/B was the first production version of the Fighting Falcon, the A being the single-seat version and the B being the two-seat version.

Production of the F-16C/D began with Block 25 (also known as MSIP Stage II). The first F-16C flew on June 19, 1984 and was delivered to the USAF one month later. Flight testing of the new F-16C revealed problems, most of which were associated with software difficulties. Development lead times which were once paced by hardware problems were now becoming paced by software bugs, and there was a shortage of people which understood both computers and airplanes.
                
Following initial deliveries to overseas units, the 312st TFTS stationed at Luke AFB in Arizona became the first continental US unit to receive the F-16C/D, getting its first planes in April of 1986 and becoming fully operational in October of 1988.
                
A total of 209 block 25 C-models and 35 D-models have been delivered to the USAF. The USAF is the sole user of this block type. At the introduction of this model, regular Air Force units received it first. With the availability of the later block 30/40/50 models comming off the production line from 1986 onwards, all of these aircraft are now operational within ANG units.

The F-16C/D is the current production version of the Fighting Falcon, the C being the single-seat version and the D being the two-seat version. It was introduced in 1984 and was intended to make the F-16 capable of all-weather operations and compatible with Beyond Visible Range (BVR) missiles such as the AIM-7 Sparrow and later the AIM-120 AMRAAM. Externally, the F-16C is almost identical to the F-16A. The only significant external difference is the introduction on the F-16C of an enlarged triangular base or &quot;island&quot; on the rear fuselage leading up to the vertical fin, with a small blade antenna protruding upward from it. Most of the differences between the F-16A/B and F-16C/D versions are internal. The F-16C/D are discriminated in different block numbers: 30-32/40-42/50-52. The block 30-32 are the first of all future F-16 to come with a common engine bay accepting both PW and GE engines. With some exception, the USAF has stationed GE powered aircraft overseas and PW powered aircraft in the continental US. The block 30/32 are capable of launching the AGM-145 Shrike ARM missile

The F-16 is considered by many to be the most agile modern fighter. Less than half the weight of the F-14, it carries a larger payload, costs less than one-fourth the F-15 and has superior maneuverability. In addition, its advanced avionics and electronics give it excellent air-to-ground precision. The F-16 can deliver a crippling ground strike and still remain a deadly air threat. The F-16 has proven itself capable of air superiority, strike, Wild Weasel and reconnaissance missions without any structural modifications; the simple addition of the proper external pods and/or ordnance is all that is required. The Fighting Falcon forms the backbone of the United States Air Force, with more than 1,500 in service.
                
Active in many air forces around the world, the F-16 has compiled an air-to-air combat record of 69 to 0, including the first Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) kill on an Iraqi MiG-29 shortly after the beginning of the Gulf War. The Falcon flew 13,500 sorties during Operation Desert Storm. Five of these aircraft were lost in combat, falling to an SA-2, an SA-3, an IR SAM and to anti-aircraft artillery. The cause of the fifth loss has not been determined.

In April of 1993, General Dynamics received an additional order from Greece for 32 more F-16CG fighters and 8 more F-16DG two-seaters. These were to be Block 50, and were scheduled for delivery from early 1997. They were to replace the last remaining Northrop F-5s serving with 341, 343, and 349 Mira.
These new F-16s were powered by the General Electric F110-GE-129 increased performance engine. The new Block 50 F-16s were LANTIRN capable--some 24 LANTIRN navigation pods and 16 targeting pods were also ordered. This makes the Greek Block 50s different from the USAF Block 50s, which are not normally LANTIRN-capable. In addition, AMRAAM missiles were acquired.

In April of 1993, General Dynamics received an additional order from Greece for 32 more F-16CG fighters and 8 more F-16DG two-seaters. These were to be Block 50, and were scheduled for delivery from early 1997. They were to replace the last remaining Northrop F-5s serving with 341, 343, and 349 Mira.
These new F-16s were powered by the General Electric F110-GE-129 increased performance engine. The new Block 50 F-16s were LANTIRN capable--some 24 LANTIRN navigation pods and 16 targeting pods were also ordered. This makes the Greek Block 50s different from the USAF Block 50s, which are not normally LANTIRN-capable. In addition, AMRAAM missiles were acquired.

The block 40/42 have bigger wheels, struts, tyres, brakes and bulged gear doors as well as a new location for the landing lights in the nose gear door. The Hud is also larger and wide angle holographic. Block 40/42 also introduced the reliability-enhanced APG-68V radar, an improved fire control computer, a digital flight control system, automatic terrain following, GPS and Lantirn capability which include the AAQ-13 navigation pod (left) and the AAQ targeting pod (right)
                
The block 42 with the less powerfull Pratt &amp; Whitney F-100-PW-220 engines have a smaller air intake and a different engine nozzle compared to the block 40 versions.

The Block 50/52 is the current production version of the F-16 Fighting Falcon. It features the Improved Performance Engines, either the F110-GE-129 for the Block 50 or the F100-PW-229 for the Block 52. The F100-PW-229 is lighter and more powerful than earlier F100s.
This version first appeared in late 1990. Production of this version is still ongoing and will be expanded well beyond 2005 with the latest aircraft delivered to Greece and Israel
                
The Block 50/52&apos;s have the capability to fire the AIM-120 Amraam, the new AGM-65G Maverick missile and the PGU-28/B 20mm cannon round. The Block 50/52 is capable of carrying the new JDAM munition, the AGM-145A/B JSOW and is the first F-16 version to integrate the AGM-84 Harpoon antishipping missile. The AGM-137 TSSAM stand-off attack missile was also foreseen in its weaponry, but subsequently cancelled. The aircraft can launch the Harpoon in line-of-sight, bearing-only, and range/bearing modes. The addition of the Harpoon gives the F-16 a significant standoff range anti-shipping capability, especially when combined with optional 600-gallon fuel tanks.
                
The F-16CJ/DJ Block 50D/52D have the HARM avionics/Launcher Interface Computer (ALIC) resulting in a full autonomous employment capability of the HARM missile. This capability adds the SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses) mission to the already extensive list of missions the F-16 is capable to perform.
Two HARM missiles are normally carried on a typical SEAD mission.

The F-16C/D block 50/52 are not Lantirn capable and have an old block30 style hud (which is still a wide angle). The block 50/52 introduced a much better engine and the Hughes APG-68 V5 radar with advanced signal processing capabilities. They are also the heavier F-16 in the serie with a MTOW of 18917 lbs. The Block50D are AGM-88 Harm capable with the Texas Instrument AN/ASQ213 HTS pod carried on the starboard side of the air intake.

The U.S. Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program selected the F-22 as the frontline fighter to succeed the F-15 after a competition between a prototype jointly developed by Lockheed, General Dynamics and Boeing and one developed by Northrop and McDonnell Douglas. Satisfying the ATF program goals required an aircraft that could operate from unimproved airfields (preferably VSTOL), had stealth characteristics across the radar and IR spectrums, fielded advanced avionics and armaments, and was reliable, easy to maintain and relatively inexpensive to procure ($40 million in 1990 dollars). A major performance goal was the aircraft&apos;s ability to fly at least Mach 1.5 without afterburner.
Although the first prototype crashed and some software problems slowed early development, the F-22 recently surpassed all requirements and milestones set by the DOD and Congress. Subject to final DOD review, pre-production will commence in 1999, with initial operational test and evaluation beginning in 2002 at Edwards Air Force Base, California.
Even without its stealth characteristics, the F-22 looks to be an impressive dogfighter. It can fly as slow as 80kts and still roll at 100 deg/sec, pitch at 60 deg/sec and exceed 60 deg AOA. Its clean configuration and powerful engines allow it to accelerate quickly. The F-22 can fly faster than Mach 1.5 without using afterburner (consuming less than one third the fuel as an F-15 at the same speed). Top speed with afterburner exceeds Mach 2. The F-22&apos;s stealth should allow it to get in the first shot during a dogfight; its maneuverability should allow it to get in the last.
The U.S. Air Force intends to buy about 450 F-22s to fill out three combat wings. Deliveries to operational squadrons are expected to begin in 2005, with final deliveries in 2013.

The Starfighter was destined to serve only briefly and in relatively small numbers with the air force of its country of origin. It was to be in the service with the air forces of other nations that the Starfighter was to achieve its reputation. The Starfighter won a large contract for NATO&apos;s next-generation multi-role fighter capable of delivering nuclear weapons, and was built in large numbers by a European consortium of aircraft manufacturers from Germany, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands. The Starfighter became an important part of NATO&apos;s nuclear deterrent during the 1960s and 1970s, and served with the air forces of Denmark, the Netherlands, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, Greece, Turkey, Canada, Spain and Norway. It was also built under license in Japan. The Starfighter also served with the air forces of Jordan, Taiwan and Pakistan. Although the Starfighter has been superceded by later types in most of the air forces with which it was originally associated, the Starfighter still serves in fairly large numbers with the air forces of Greece, Taiwan, and Italy.
A total of 2580 of all Starfighter types were produced, making the aircraft one of the most important Western postwar military aircraft. However, in the mid-1960s, when the Starfighter first entered service in significant numbers, the aircraft was involved in a large number of accidents. Because of the high accident rate, the Starfighter became a controversial aircraft and there were charges that the aircraft was an intrinsically flawed and dangerous one. However, in retrospect, the Starfighter was not any more precarious to fly than lots of other military aircraft of the day, and the high accident rate can be blamed more on inadequate and insufficient crew training rather than on any defect in the basic design.

Because of late delivery and protracted development of the F-111D, 94 F-111Es were ordered with simplified avionics and the TF30-P-3 turbofan engine. They were ordered in 1968. Even though the F-111E had a later series letter than the F-111D, the E preceded the D into service.
The first flight of an F-111E took place on August 20, 1969, and deliveries to the Air Force took place from 1969 to May 28, 1971. A total of 94 were built.
F-111Es of the 20th TFW were used in Operation Desert Storm in early 1991, flying out of bases at Incirlik, Turkey. They lacked the precision guided munitions capability of the later F-111F, and so they carried mainly Mk 82 or Mk 84 standard conventional bombs and other conventional ordnance against targets in the northern part of Iraq. None were lost in combat, which is a remarkable testament to the efficacy of the F-111E in combat.

The F-111F was the final F-111 version produced for the Tactical Air Command (TAC). It was ordered on July 1, 1970. It differed from the F-111D in having more advanced electronics which were nevertheless simplified and more reliable. It carried the Mark IIB avionics suite which combined F-111D and FB-111A navigational and digital computer systems (but excluding the F-111D&apos;s AN/APN-189 Doppler radar navigation set) plus numerous other FB-111A components such as the AN/APQ-144 attack radar and some simpler, less costly avionics systems used by earlier F-111s. The APQ-144 attack radar of the F-111F has a new 2.5-mile display ring made possible by a 0.2 s pulse-width capability. The F-111F also featured an improved landing gear. It was powered by a pair of 25,100 lb.s.t. TF30-P-100 turbofans (although the first 30 had TF30-P-9s and were subsequently re-engined).
                
The last F-111F was delivered to the USAF in September of 1976. 106 F-111Fs were built.
                
During Desert Storm, the 67 F-111Fs of the 48th TFW operated from air bases in Saudi Arabia. Because of their ability to deliver precision-guided ordinance in all-weather conditions, they played a key role in the destruction of the Iraqi command and control structure and in the elimination of key targets in the Kuwait theatre of operations. No F-111Fs were lost in combat during the Persian Gulf War.

Developed under a veil of secrecy, the F-117 was designed to be virtually undetectable by radar, infrared, sound and vision. Nicknamed &quot;the Cockroach&quot; for its appearance, the F-117&apos;s composition, shape, engine design and color make it all but invisible to opposing air defenses on night strike missions. Furthermore, its infrared navigation system and swiveling laser designator allow the near-perfect delivery of ordnance under widely varying conditions. In air-to-air combat, the F-117 has a simple but effective strategy: disappear. If by chance an opposing pilot did happen upon a Stealth fighter, the foe&apos;s missiles would have difficulty locking onto the elusive plane. However, the F-117&apos;s comparatively low speed and lack of air-to-air weaponry make it a 50-million dollar clay pigeon for any true fighter craft.

Single seat version. Total of 371 F/A-18As for USN and USMC as escort fighters to replace F-4s and as attack aircraft replacing A-7s under FY79 to FY85 contracts;
November 1980; in service 7 January 1983 with Marine Fighter/Attack Squadron VMFA-314 at MCAS El Toro, California; first Navy squadron, VFA-113 of Pacific Fleet, October 1983; first Atlantic Fleet squadrons formed NAS Cecil Field, Florida, 1 February 1985; same month VFA-113 and VFA-25 embarked in USS Constellation.
At least 28 Navy Reserve aircraft upgraded to F/A-18A+ in Engineering Change Proposal 560 (ECP 560) programme during 1999, bringing them to a standard closely approximating that of the F/A-18C. Similar, but more elaborate, programme launched by US Marine Corps in FY00 budget, which featured request for funds to initiate Engineering Change Proposal 583 (ECP 583); project to begin with 24 F/A-18As and expected to total 76, in two active and four reserve squadrons. Work entails installation of AN/APG-73 radar and Rockwell Collins AN/ARC-210(V) UHF/VHF AM/FM jam-resistant radio suite, including Have Quick II, SINCGARS and MIDS Link 16 communications. Additional avionics changes concern provision of BAE Systems AN/APX-111(V) combined IFF interrogater/transponder, Smiths Industries AN/AYQ-9 stores management system, night vision display system, upgraded General Dynamics XN-8 mission computer and digital display indicator; upgraded aircraft able to employ newer sensors, such as Lockheed Martin AN/AAS-38B FLIR pod, and more capable weaponry, such as AIM-120 AMRAAM and JDAM.
ECP 583 also to be adopted by Canada at cost of more than C$900 million and may eventually be implemented by others that have yet to address issue of avionics upgrading.
                
These old Hornets are only to be found in the USN and Navy reserve.
Spain is still in the possesion of 91 F/A-18 A/B known to them as C.15 and CE.15.
                
In 1992, the original Hughes AN/APG-65 radar was replaced with the Hughes (now Raytheon) AN/APG-73, a faster and more capable radar. A-model Hornets that have been upgraded to the AN/APG-73 are designated F/A-18A+

The F/A-18B is the two-seat combat trainer version of the F/A-18A. Two full-scale development two-seaters (BuNos 160781 and 160784) were followed by 39 production F/A-18Bs in Blocks 4 to 21. Initially designated TF/A-18As, they were essentially intended as trainers, but retained full combat capability. To make room for the second seat, internal fuel capacity was reduced by about 6 percent.
                
In 1992, the original Hughes AN/APG-65 radar was replaced with the Hughes (now Raytheon) AN/APG-73, a faster and more capable radar. A-model Hornets that have been upgraded to the AN/APG-73 are designated F/A-18A+

As the current modern attack plane on U.S. carriers, the Hornet fills a vital role in American military strategy. The F-14 was designed solely for air-to-air combat, whereas the F/A-18 was designed for air-to-surface missions as well. However, the F/A-18 sacrifices some performance in each of these areas to achieve this flexibility. Like the Falcon, the Hornet is light, cheap and quite agile. These qualities, coupled with its immense ordnance load, make it the Navy&apos;s strike fighter of choice. Laser designator pods give it excellent accuracy in the air and on the ground. Its agility and Sparrow AAMs make the F/A-18 a serious air threat; but since it serves alongside the dedicated air-to-air Tomcat, the Hornet is almost always used in the attack role.
The F/A-18C is an improved version of the A model. It has night attack capabilities provided added by a Hughes AN/AAR-50 thermal imaging set and AN/AAR-38 Nite Hawk FLIR pod. Additionally, C model´s pilots can use night vision goggles as the C model´s cockpit illumination has been adapted accordingly.

Although larger than the previous versions of the F/A-18, the E series is a single-seat craft. It uses the extra space for several improvements over the previous models, including the Hughes AN/APG-73 Radar system and ATARS recon pod. The E series also has slightly increased range and weapons load, thus making the F/A-18E more deadly than its predecessors.The Super Hornet can carry approximately 17,750 pounds (8,032 kg) of external load on eleven stations. It has an all-weather air-to-air radar and a control system for accurate delivery of conventional or guided weapons. There are two wing tip stations, four inboard wing stations for fuel tanks or air-to-ground weapons, two nacelle fuselage stations for Sparrows or sensor pods, and one centerline station for fuel or air-to-ground weapons. An internal 20 mm M61A1 Vulcan cannon is mounted in the nose.
Roll-out of the first Super Hornet occurred in September 1995, and it flew for the first time in November 1995, ahead of schedule and nearly 1,000 pounds under specified weight. In January 1997, the Super Hornet successfully conducted its initial sea trials on board the Navy&apos;s newest aircraft carrier, the U.S.S. John C. Stennis (CVN 74).
The Navy is planning to procure a minimum of 548 Super Hornets, and possibly as many as 1,000. These numbers could vary depending on the progress of the Joint Strike Fighter Program. As part of the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), production of the Super Hornet was cut from 1000 to 548 units. Production of the aircraft commenced in FY 1997, and it is expected to attain initial operational capability (IOC) in FY 2001. Twelve aircraft were funded in FY 1997; procurement numbers increased to 20 in FY 1998, 30 in FY 1999, and reached a final maximum rate of 48 per year in FY 2001.

The Fan Song is the missile control radar for the SA-2. The system has two operating modes: target acquisition and automatic tracking. While in target acquisition mode, the radar will perform a sector scan around the bearing and altitude of a suspected target. Once the target is located, the radar is switched into automatic tracking mode, a launcher is brought to bear ,and the system fires up to three missiles at six second intervals. Initial search-and-acquisition for an SA-2 battery is normally performed by a Spoon Rest or Flat Face radar, but other search systems such as the Long Track or Bar Lock can also be used. The Fan Song is fairly susceptible to ECM and chaff. Later models of the radar have an auxiliary optical tracking system for use when jamming prevents automatic tracking. Another system associated with the SA-2 is Side Net height-finder radar.

The Farragut-class destroyer was a group of 10 guided missile destroyers built for the United States Navy (USN) during the 1950s. They were the second destroyer class to be named for Admiral David Farragut. The class is sometimes referred to as the Coontz class, since Coontz was first to be designed and built as a guided missile ship, whereas the previous three ships were designed as all-gun units and converted later.The class was originally envisioned as a Destroyer Leader class (DL/DLG, verbally referred to as &quot;Frigates&quot;), but was reclassified as Guided Missile Destroyers following the 1975 ship reclassification.

The AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo, commonly known as the Indigenous Defense Fighter (IDF), is a multirole combat aircraft named after Chiang Ching-kuo, the late President of the Republic of China (Taiwan). The aircraft made its first flight in 1989. It was delivered to Republic of China Air Force in January 1994 and entered service in 1997. All 130 production aircraft had been manufactured by 1999.
                
The IDF program was initiated when the United States refused to sell F-20 Tigershark and F-16 Fighting Falcon jet fighters to Taiwan following diplomatic pressure from China. Taiwan therefore decided to develop an advanced indigenous jet fighter. The IDF jet fighter project was designed and built by the Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation (AIDC) based in Taichung, Taiwan.

The Stinger has one of the best track records of any shoulder-launched SAM. Afghani soldiers armed with Stingers downed almost 100 Soviet helicopters and planes. The all-aspect IR tracking of the Stingers allows them to target aircraft from multiple angles and makes them unlikely to be diverted by flares. This weapon has been so successful that it has been fitted onto aircraft for use as an anti-aircraft missile o fire the missile, a BCU (Battery Coolant Unit) is inserted into the gripstock. This device consists of a supply of liquid argon which is injected into the seeker to cool it to operating temperature, and a thermal battery which provides power for target acquisition: a single BCU provides power and coolant for roughly 45 seconds, after which another must be inserted if the missile has not been fired. The BCUs are somewhat sensitive to abuse, and have a limited shelf life due to the pressurised liquid argon leaking. The IFF system receives power from a rechargeable battery which is part of the IFF interrogator box which plugs into the base of the gripstock's pistol grip. Guidance to the target is initially through proportional navigation, then switches to another mode that directs the missile towards the target airframe instead of its exhaust plume.
                                      
There are three main variants in use: the Stinger basic, STINGER-Passive Optical Seeker Technique (POST), and STINGER-Reprogrammable Microprocessor (RMP). These correspond to the FIM-92A, FIM-92B, and FIM-92C and later variants respectively.
                                 
The POST has a dual-detector seeker: IR and UV. This allows it to distinguish targets from countermeasures much better than the Redeye and FIM-92A, which have IR-only. While modern flares can have an IR signature that is closely matched to the launching aircraft's engine exhaust, there is a readily distinguishable difference in UV signature between flares and jet engines.[1] The Stinger-RMP is so-called because of its ability to load a new set of software via ROM chip inserted in the grip at the depot. If this download to the missile fails during power-up, basic functionality runs off the on-board ROM. The four-processor RMP has 4 KB of RAM for each processor. Since the downloaded code runs from RAM, there is little space to spare, particularly for processors dedicated to seeker input processing and target analysis.

		<DescriptionData>
The EL/M-20600 is an all-weather Radar Targeting Pod (RTP) developed and manufactured by IAI's Elta Systems Group to operate in day and night conditions penetrating clouds, rain, smoke, smog and fog. This pod was designed to support tactical fighter aircraft in air-to-surface attack missions delivering high resolution radar imagery. It was developed as an affordable alternative to proven electro-optical targeting pods for long-range, standoff operations. This Image Intelligence (IMINT) system provides real-time tactical reconnaissance, high precision strike and post raid assessment with the carrier aircraft operating at altitudes of up to 50,000 feet (15,200 meters).
                            
The IAI EL/M-2060P is a high performance Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) with Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) reconnaissance system. The complete system consists of the SAR/GMTI and a C, X or Ku band data link mounted in a 590 kg pod that can be carried externally together with a Ground Exploitation Station (GES).
                          
The EL/M-2060P is capable of producing images of near photographic quality in all weathers, day or night and transmitting the images in near real-time via the data link over a range of over 250 nautical miles to the GES. The SAR/GMTI can operate in either STRIP Mode, for coverage of very large areas at stand-off ranges, or SPOT mode to obtain a high resolution image of an area of interest. The data is also recorded on-board allowing it to also be interpreted once the aircraft has landed. The GES can be installed in either a fixed or transportable location and is equipped with a variety of workstations to allow rapid data reporting and exploitation.

In the summer of 2005 it was announced that the Indian Air Force had ordered a number of EL/M-2060 pods in a $150 million deal for its Su-30MKI. The pod was different from the version operated by the Israelis as it will also incorporate an electro/optical sensor provided by Elop.
         
The Su-30MKIs with the El/M-2060P pods are based along the LAC to conduct reconnaissance missions and provide SAR imagery for target designation and battlefield analysis

&quot;Flat Face&quot; is the NATO code name for the P-15 EWR radar.
                
The P-15 is a high mobility radar. With the antenna mounted directly on the single truck (Zil-157) used for transport, the system could be deployed and taken down in no more than 10 minutes. The P-15 uses two open frame elliptical parabolic antenna accomplishing both transmission and reception, each antenna being fed by a single antenna feed. The radar can rapidly shift its frequency to one of four pre-set frequencies to avoid active interference, with passive interference being removed by a coherent doppler filter. Azimuth was determined by mechanical scanning with an associated accompanying PRV-11 (NATO reporting name &quot;Side Net&quot;) used to determine elevation. A secondary radar for IFF is generally used in conjunction with the P-15, generally the 1L22 &quot;Parol&quot;.

The 9K52 Luna-M is a Soviet short-range artillery rocket system. It fires unguided and spin-stabilized 9M21 rockets. &quot;FROG&quot; is a backronym for &quot;Free Rocket Over Ground&quot;. 
                      
While still in limited service, the Frog-7 tactical missile is being replaced in the field by newer and more accurate missiles. However, the Frog-7 is still a considerable threat against concentrations of enemy ground units. Furthermore, its tactical nuclear capability ensures that even a near miss could prove devastating.

The Guided Bomb Unit-10 (GBU-10) utilizes the 2000 pound general purpose or penetrating warhead. The operator illuminates a target with a laser designator and then the munition guides to a spot of laser energy reflected from the target. The GBU-10 consists of an MK-84 2,000 pound bomb with an added laser guidance package. The GBU-1OI mates a BLU-109B weapon with a Paveway II laser guidance kit. This improved 2,000-pound bomb is used against targets requiring deeper penetration.
                
The munition was used during Operation Desert Storm, and, according to the Air Force, hit 78 percent of its targets. In Operation Desert Storm, GBU-10/10Is were used extensively by F-15Es and F-111Fs mainly against bridges, Scuds, C3I (command, control, communications, intelligence) nodes, and bunkers. Of the 2,637 expended,&apos;44 over one- third were dropped by F-111Fs, and the rest by F-117s, F-15Es, and Navy and Marine Corps aircraft.
                
There are two generations of GBU-10 LGBs: Paveway I with fixed wings and Paveway II with folding wings. Paveway II models have the following improvements: detector optics and housing made of
injection-molded plastic to reduce weight and cost; increased detector sensitivity; reduced thermal battery delay after release; increased maximum canard deflection; laser coding; folding wings for carriage, and increased detector field of view. (Paveway II&apos;s instantaneous field of view is thirty percent greater than that of the Paveway I&apos;s field of view).

The Guided Bomb Unit-12 (GBU-12) utilizes a 500 pound general purpose warhead. The operator illuminates a target with a laser designator and then the munition guides to a spot of laser energy reflected from the target.
                
The munition was used during Operation Desert Storm, and, according to the Air Force, hit 88 percent of its targets. During Desert Storm the GBU-12 was dropped by F-lllFs, F-15Es, and A-6s, mostly against fixed armor. It was the F-111F tank-busting weapon of choice. Of the 4,493 GBU-12s employed, over half were dropped by the F-lllF.
                
There are two generations of GBU-12 LGBs: Paveway I with fixed wings and Paveway II with folding wings. Paveway II models have the following improvements: detector optics and housing made of injection-molded plastic to reduce weight and cost; increased detector sensitiv- ity; reduced thermal battery delay after release; increased maximum canard deflection; laser coding; folding wings for carriage, and increased detector field of view. (Paveway II&apos;s instantaneous field of view is thirty percent greater than that of the Paveway I&apos;s field of view).

The GBU-15 bomb is an unpowered, glide weapon used to destroy high value enemy targets. It is designed to be used with F-15E and F-111F aircraft. The GBU-15 provides the capability for accurate (automatic or manual) guided delivery of a MK-84 bomb at increased ranges. The GBU-15&apos;s effective standoff range is greater than that of laser-guided munitions, since the GBU-15 does not need to have acquired the target before it is released. The weapon is remotely controlled by a datalink system, and the weapon systems opera- tor locates the target area and the specific aimpoint by observing the video transmitted from the weapon. The weapon&apos;s midcourse flight path can be adjusted either automatically or manually. Weapon video is either electro-optical (TV camera) or infrared, and generated in the nose of the weapon.
                
The weapon consists of consisting of various interchangeable guidance, fusing, and control systems designed to meet specific mission requirements, that are attached to either an MK-84 or BLU-109 penetrating warhead. Each weapon has five components -- a forward guidance section, warhead adapter section, control module, airfoil components and a weapon data link.
                
The guidance section is attached to the nose of the weapon and contains either a television guidance system for daytime or an imaging infrared system for night or limited, adverse weather operations. A data link in the tail section sends guidance updates to the control aircraft that enables the weapon systems operator to guide the bomb by remote control to its target.
                
An external electrical conduit extends the length of the warhead which attaches the guidance adapter and control unit. The conduit carries electrical signals between the guidance and control sections. The umbilical receptacle passes guidance and control data between cockpit control systems of the launching aircraft and the weapon prior to launch.
                
The rear control section consists of four wings are in an &quot;X&quot;-like arrangement with trailing edge flap control surfaces for flight maneuvering. The control module contains the autopilot, which collects steering data from the guidance section and converts the information into signals that move the wing control surfaces to change the weapon&apos;s flight path.
                
The GBU-15 may be used in direct or indirect attack. In a direct attack, the pilot selects a target before launch, locks the weapon guidance system onto it and launches the weapon. The weapon automatically guides itself to the target, enabling the pilot to leave the area. In an indirect attack, the weapon is guided by remote control after launch. The pilot releases the weapon and, via remote control, searches for the target. Once the target is acquired, the weapon can be locked to the target or manually guided via the date-link system. This highly maneuverable weapon has a low-to-medium altitude delivery capability with high accuracy. It also has a standoff capability.
                
During Desert Storm, all 71 GBU-15 modular glide bombs used were dropped from F-111F aircraft. Most notably, GBU-15s were the munitions used for destroying the oil manifolds on the storage tanks to stop oil from spilling into the Gulf. These GBU-15s sealed flaming oil pipeline manifolds sabotaged by Saddam Hussein&apos;s troops.
                
The Air Force Development Test Center, Eglin Air Force Base, Fla., began developing the GBU-15 in 1974. It was a product improvement of the early guided bombs used during the Southeast Asia conflict. Flight testing of the weapon began in 1975. The GBU-15 with television guidance, completed full-scale operational test and evaluation in November 1983. In February 1985, initial operational test and evaluation was completed on the imaging infrared guidance seeker.
                
In December 1987, the program management responsibility for the GBU-15 weapon system transferred from the Air Force Systems Command to the Air Force Logistics Command. The commands merged to become the Air Force Materiel Command in 1992.
                
The Inertial Terrain-Aided Guidance (ITAG) system is an adverse weather, precision guidance system for the GBU-15. It replaces the guidance system for this weapon. ITAG is an inertial navigator who uses updates from a radar altimeter correlated with terrain elevation maps. GPS is used to initialize the inertial navigator prior to weapon release. ITAG, being developed by Sandia National Laboratory, will give Joint Force Commanders the capability to accurately deliver weapons against NBC targets during a wide range of adverse weather conditions. The ITAG kit &quot;straps on&quot; to 2000-pound class conventional bombs to make a precision-guided weapon, and it will make it possible to plan attacks to take advantage of local weather conditions which may be favorable to minimizing the dispersal of released NBC agents. The ITAG uses GPS-initialized inertial navigation which is augmented by a terrain-reading, all-weather, highaltitude, precision radar altimeter. The real-time onboard navigation computer correlates radar altimeter data with previously acquired digitized, three-dimensional synthetic aperture radar terrain maps stored on board the weapon. Unlike current laser-guided bombs which can only be employed in clear air-mass conditions, the ITAG will be able to achieve 3-meter circular error probable (CEP) accuracy in adverse weather.
                
On 23 April 1999, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force gave direction to provide the GBU-15 air-to-surface weapon with Global Positioning System, or GPS, guidance giving it an all-weather capability. In early May 1999 contracts were signed with Applied Sciences Engineering International of Niceville FL and Raytheon Defense Systems of Tucson AZ. The two contractors&apos; concepts are different but proven and compatible with the F-15E. The total quick reaction program including these two contracts and all government costs total $7 million for the first phase of additional GPS guidance to the GBU-15. An unreleased quantity of the enhanced weapon were delivered to combat units by 01 July 1999. During the second phase, the best concepts of both contractors will be adopted. They will then work as a team to upgrade an additional 1,200 to 1,500 GBU-15s, which is expected to cost approximately $50 million.

The Guided Bomb Unit-12 (GBU-16) utilizes a 1000 pound general purpose warhead. The operator illuminates a target with a laser designator and then the munition guides to a spot of laser energy reflected from the target. The GBU-16 consists of a MK-83 1,000-pound bomb modified with a common Paveway II laser guidance kit. During Desert Storm virtually all 219 GBU-16s were dropped by Navy A- 6Es, which had the capability to lase the target themselves (self-designation).
                
FA/18 Hornet aircraft flying from USS Enterprise (CVN 65) dropped GBU-16 laser guided bombs during the waves of attacks against Iraq in support of Operation Desert Fox in December 1998.

This is a 500 lb Paveway III laser guided bomb used on many US aircraft as F/A-18, F-15, F-4&apos;s, F-16 and F-111 . In 1996 Texas Instruments announced that a privately funded development had used a Mk-82 warhead to the Paveway III and this new version was designated GBU-22/B The Paveway III series does not have the bang-bang guidance of the Paveway II series, allowing for a much more efficient flight path extending the range of the weapons.
                
Engagement Sequence
                
The Paveway III series bombs have a much wider launch envelope, greater standoff range and a more sensitive seeker head than the Paveway II series. In addition, these newer bombs are programmed so they can be released during a low altitude, level attack run. If the bomb is dropped with a level release at low altitude, the weapon will perform a pull-up and gain roughly 300 ft, at which point it levels out and flies straight until it detects laser illumination from the target. Improvements in the Paveway III&apos;s seeker and guidance unit also correct the Paveway II&apos;s tendency to bleed away too much airspeed during maneuvering.

Paveway III Bomb Series
Paveway LGBs are a family of laser-guided bombs assembled from three main components: a laser-homing seeker, a tail-fin wing assembly and a warhead (usually a standard general-purpose bomb). The seeker detects laser energy and guides the weapon to a target illuminated by an external source. This laser illumination can be provided by the delivery aircraft, by another aircraft or by ground forces.
                
Engagement Sequence
The Paveway III series bombs have a much wider launch envelope, greater standoff range and a more sensitive seeker head than the Paveway II series. In addition, these newer bombs are programmed so they can be released during a low altitude, level attack run. If the bomb is dropped with a level release at low altitude, the weapon will perform a pull-up and gain roughly 300 ft, at which point it levels out and flies straight until it detects laser illumination from the target. Improvements in the Paveway III&apos;s seeker and guidance unit also correct the Paveway II&apos;s tendency to bleed away too much airspeed during maneuvering.
                
GBU-24
The GBU-24 uses a BLU-109 Penetrator bomb as its warhead. This weapon has more penetrating power than a GBU-10, but less explosive material.
                
GBU-27
The GBU-27 is similar to the GBU-24, but is modified for use by the F-117A Stealth fighter.
                
GBU-28
The GBU-28 is a mammoth bomb machined from a howitzer barrel and used to destroy underground bunkers. It is capable of penetrating 20 ft of reinforced concrete or up to 100 ft into the earth. Only the F-15E Strike Eagle and F-111 can deliver the GBU-28.

The Guided Bomb Unit-24 (GBU-24) Low Level Laser Guided Bomb [LLLGB] consists of either a 2,000-pound MK-84 general purpose or BLU-109 penetrator bomb modified with a Paveway III low-level laserguided bomb kit to add the proportional guidance in place of the bang-bang type used in the Paveway II. The LLLGB was developed in response to Sophisticated enemy air defenses, poor visibility, and to counter limitations in low ceilings. The weapon is designed for low altitude delivery and with a capability for improved standoff ranges to reduce exposure. The GBU-24 LLLGB/Paveway III has low-level, standoff capability of more than 10 nautical miles. Performance envelopes for all modes of delivery are improved because the larger wings of the GBU-24 increases maneuverability. Paveway III also has increased seeker sensitivity and a larger field of regard.
                
The operator illuminates a target with a laser designator and then the munition guides to a spot of laser energy reflected from the target. One way to deliver LGBs from low altitude is a loft attack. In this maneuver, the aircraft pulls up sharply at a predetermined point some miles from the target and the LGB is lofted upward and toward the target. However, if the LGB guidance system detects reflected laser energy from the target designator too soon after release, it tends to pull the LGW down below its required trajectory and the bomb will impact well short of the target.
                
This bomb is not nearly as delivery parameter sensitive as is the Paveway II LGB, nor is it affected by early laser designation. After a proper low altitude delivery, the LLLGB will maintain level flight while looking for reflected laser energy. If it does not detect reflected laser energy, it will maintain level flight to continue beyond the designated target, overflying friendly positions, to impact long, rather than short of the target.
                
Unlike the Paveway II LGB, the LLLGB can correct for relatively large deviations from planned release parameters in the primary delivery mode (low-altitude level delivery). It also has a larger delivery envelope for the dive, glide and loft modes than does the earlier LGB. The wide field of view and midcourse guidance modes programmed in the LLLGB allow for a &quot;Point Shoot&quot; delivery capability. This capability allows the pilot to attack the target by pointing the aircraft at the target and releasing the weapon after obtaining appropriate sight indications. The primary advantage of this capability is that accurate dive/tracking is not required to solve wind drift problems.
                
In the Gulf War all of the 1,181 GBU-24s were released by F-111Fs.
                
In 1996 the Navy conducted tests of the F-14A Tomcat with the GBU-24B/B Hard Target Penetrator Laser-Guided Bomb at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Md., as part of an air-to-ground development program to support clearance for use of the weapon in the fleet by F-14 Tomcats.
                
Key accomplishments in 1996 included demonstration of controlled weapon penetration and detonation depth using the Hard-Target Smart Fuse [HTSF] and successful integration of the GBU- 24/ HTSF with F-15E and F/A- 18 aircraft. The Hard-Target Smart Fuse, developed at the Wright lab, features an accelerometer that can be programmed to detonate the bomb at a precisely specified depth significantly enhancing munition lethality. The Defense Special Weapons Agency (DSWA) Counterproliferation Initiative (CPI) requires development, integration and certification of HTSF with GBU-24 B/B (Navy BLU-109) and GBU-24 D/B (Navy BLU-116) under this effort. Under a separate effort, CPI will integrate the GBU-24 B/B and GBU-24 D/B configuration HTSFs into the CPI modified Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM) and Tactical Land Attack Missile (TLAM) weapons.

The Guided Bomb Unit-27 (GBU-27) is a GBU-24 modified for delivery by the F-117 stealth fighter. The operator illuminates a target with a laser designator and then the munition guides to a spot of laser energy reflected from the target. It uses a 2,000-pound penetrating warhead against hard targets. The GBU-27 was used in Operation Desert Storm. According to the Air Force, the GBU-27 hit 70 percent of its targets.
                
The GBU-27 was designed specifically for use by the F-117&apos;s advanced target acquisition/designator system. The GBU-27 uses a BLU-109 improved performance 2,000 pound bomb developed in 1985 under the project name HAVE VOID. The BLU-109 was designed for use against hardened structures and features a high-strength forged steel case and a new delayed-action tail fuze. It carries 550 pounds of high explosives and can penetrate more than six feet of reinforced concrete.
                
The GBU-27 uses a modified Paveway II guidance control unit which provides &quot;terminal trajectory shaping&quot; for optimum impact angle against various target structures. For example, it will hit an aircraft shelter with a vertical impact, but make a horizontal approach to a bridge support. A Paveway II tail assembly with folding wings completes the bomb.
                
The F-117 can carry two GBU-27s in two weapons bays and is reportedly capable of hitting a one square meter target from an altitude of 25,000 feet.

The Guided Bomb Unit-28 (GBU-28) is a special weapon developed for penetrating hardened Iraqi command centers located deep underground. The GBU-28 is a 5,000-pound laser-guided conventional munition that uses a 4,400-pound penetrating warhead. The bombs are modified Army artillery tubes, weigh 4,637 pounds, and contain 630 pounds of high explosives. They are fitted with GBU-27 LGB kits, 14.5 inches in diameter and almost 19 feet long. The operator illuminates a target with a laser designator and then the munition guides to a spot of laser energy reflected from the target.
                
The GBU 28 &quot;Bunker Buster&quot; was put together in record time to support targeting of the Iraqi hardened command bunker by adapting existing materiel. The GBU-28 was not even in the early stages of research when Kuwait was invaded. The USAF asked industry for ideas in the week after combat operations started. Work on the bomb was conducted in research laboratories including the Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate located at Eglin AFB, Florida and the Watervliet Armory in New York. The bomb was fabricated starting on 1 February, using surplus 8-inch artillery tubes as bomb casings because of their strength and weight. The official go-ahead for the project was issued on 14 February, and explosives for the initial units were hand-loaded by laboratory personnel into a bomb body that was partially buried upright in the ground. The first two units were delivered to the USAF on 16 and 17 February, and the first flight to test the guidance software and fin configuration was conducted on 20 February. These tests were successful and the program proceeded with a contract let on 22 February. A sled test on 26 February proved that the bomb could penetrate over 20 feet of concrete, while an earlier flight test had demonstrated the bomb&apos;s ability to penetrate more than 100 feet of earth. The first two operational bombs were delivered to the theater on 27 February.
                
The Air Force produced a limited quantity of the GBU-28 during Operation Desert Storm to attack multilayered, hardened underground targets. Only two of these weapons were dropped in Desert Storm, both by F-111Fs. One weapon hit its precise aimpoint, and the onboard aircraft video recorder displayed an outpouring of smoke from an entrance way approximately 6 seconds after impact. After Operation Desert Storm, the Air Force incorporated some modifications, and further tested the munition. The Fy1997 budget request contained $18.4 million to procure 161 GBU-28 hard target penetrator bombs.

The Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) is a guidance tail kit that converts existing unguided free-fall bombs into accurate, all-weather guided bombs. The JDAM kit consists of a new tail section containing an inertial navigational system and a global positioning system (GPS) guidance control unit. JDAM can be launched from approximately 15 miles from the target and each is independently targeted. JDAM was jointly developed by the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy, is built by Boeing, and can be fitted to the standard Mk.80 series of free-fall bombs. Each kit costs around $18,000 (USD).

The Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) is a guidance kit that converts unguided bombs, or &quot;dumb bombs&quot;, into all-weather precision-guided munitions. JDAM-equipped bombs are guided by an integrated inertial guidance system coupled to a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, giving them a published range of up to 15 nautical miles (28 km). JDAM-equipped bombs range from 500 pounds (227 kg) to 2,000 pounds (907 kg).The JDAM's guidance system was jointly developed by the United States Air Force and United States Navy, hence the &quot;joint&quot; in JDAM.[2] When installed on a bomb, the JDAM kit is given a GBU (Guided Bomb Unit) nomenclature, superseding the Mark 80 or BLU (Bomb, Live Unit) nomenclature of the bomb to which it is attached.
           
The JDAM is not a stand-alone weapon; rather it is a &quot;bolt-on&quot; guidance package that converts unguided gravity bombs into precision-guided munitions (PGMs). The key components of the system consist of a tail section with aerodynamic control surfaces, a (body) strake kit, and a combined inertial guidance system and GPS guidance control unit.
         
The JDAM was meant to improve upon laser-guided bomb and imaging infrared technology, which can be hindered by bad ground and weather conditions. Laser seekers are now being fitted to some JDAMs.

The Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) GBU-31 is a tail kit to meet both USAF and Navy needs, with the Air Force as the lead service. The program will produce a weapon with high accuracy, all-weather, autonomous, conventional bombing capability. JDAM will upgrade the existing inventory of general purpose and penetrator unitary bombs, and a product improvement may add a terminal seeker to improve accuracy. JDAM can be launched from approximately 15 miles from the target
and each is independently targeted.
                
JDAM is not intended to replace any existing weapon system; rather, it is to provide accurate delivery of general purpose bombs in adverse weather conditions. The JDAM will upgrade the existing inventory of Mk-83 1,000- and Mk-84 2,000-pound general purpose unitary bombs and the 2,000-pound hard target penetrator bomb by integrating a guidance kit consisting of an inertial navigation system/global positioning system guidance kit.
                
The 1,000-pound variant of JDAM is designated the GBU-31, and the 2,000-pound version of the JDAM is designated the GBU-32. JDAM variants for the Mk-80 250-pound and Mk-81 500-pound bombs are designated GBU-29 and GBU-30, respectively. Hard Target penetrators being changed into low-cost JDAMs included the 2,000 pound BLU-109 and 1,000 pound BLU-110.
                
Mission plans are loaded to the host aircraft prior to take off and include release envelope, target coordinates and weapon terminal parameters. The weapon automatically begins its initialisation process during captive carry when power is applied by the aircraft. The weapon performs bit, and aligns its INS with the host aircraft&apos;s system. Targeting data is automatically down loaded to the weapon from the host aircraft. When the host aircraft reaches the release point within the Launch Acceptable Region (LAR), the weapon is released. Weapon manoeuvrability and range are enhanced by fixed aerodynamic surfaces (mid-body strakes) attached to the bomb body.
                
Once released, the bomb&apos;s INS/GPS will take over and guide the bomb to its target regardless of weather. Guidance is accomplished via the tight coupling of an accurate Global Positioning System (GPS) with a 3-axis Inertial Navigation System (INS). The Guidance Control Unit (GCU) provides accurate guidance in both GPS-aided INS modes of operation (13 meter (m) Circular Error Probable (CEP)) and INS-only modes of operation (30 m CEP). INS only is defined as GPS quality hand-off from the aircraft with GPS unavailable to the weapon (e.g. GPS jammed). In the event JDAM is unable to receive GPS signals after launch for any reason, jamming or otherwise, the INS will provide rate and acceleration measurements which the weapon software will develop into a navigation solution. The Guidance Control Unit provides accurate guidance in both GPS-aided INS modes of operation and INSonly modes of operation. This inherent JDAM capability will counter the threat from near-term technological advances in GPS jamming.
                
The weapon system allows launch from very low to very high altitude and can be launched in a dive, toss, loft or in straight and level flight with an on-axis or off-axis delivery. JDAM also allows multiple target engagements on a single pass delivery. JDAM provides the user with a variety of targeting schemes, such as preplanned and in-flight captive carriage retargeting.
                
JDAM is being developed by Lockheed Martin and Boeing [McDonald Douglas]. In October 1995, the Air Force awarded a contract for EMD and for the first 4,635 JDAM kits at an average unit cost of $18,000, less than half the original $40,000 estimate. As a result of JDAM&apos;s pilot program status, low-rate initial production was accelerated nine months, to the latter half of FY 1997. On April 30, 1997, the Air Force announced the decision to initiate low-rate initial production (LRIP) of JDAM, with the first production lot of 937 JDAM kits. The JDAM Integrated Product Team achieved a phenomenal 53 guided JDAM weapon releases in the six months prior to the LRIP decision. JDAM demonstrated high reliability and outstanding accuracy. Twenty-two of the weapon releases were accomplished during an early Air Force operational assessment. Over a four-week period operational crews put JDAM through an operationally representative evaluation, including targets shrouded by clouds and obscured by snow. All 22 weapons successfully performed up to their operational requirements including overall accuracy of 10.3 meters, significantly better than the 13 meter requirement. Early operational capability JDAMs have been delivered to Whiteman Air Force Base, Mo., and low-rate, initial production JDAM deliveries begin on 02 May 1998. McDonnell Douglas Corporation of Berkeley, MO, was awarded on 02 April 1999, a $50,521,788 face value increase to a firm-fixed-price contract to provide for low rate initial production of 2,527 Joint Direct Attack Munitions kits. The work is expected to be completed by January 2001.
                
On 28 April 2000 McDonnell Douglas Corp., Berkeley, Mo., was awarded a $5,648,796 modification to a firm-fixed-price contract to provide for incorporation of Pin-Lock Tail Actuator System technology into the production effort for 8,163 Joint Direct Attack Munitions kits. The Pin-Lock Tail Actuator System provides a more durable and accurate method of manoeuvring the tail fins of the JDAM than the existing Friction Brake technology. Expected contract completion date was 31 March 2001.
                
The JDAM program is nearing the end of its development phase. More than 250 flight tests involved five Air Force and Navy aircraft. JDAM will be carried on virtually all Air Force fighters and bombers, including the B-1, B-2, B-52, F-15E, F-16, F-22, F-117, and F/A-18.
                
JDAM was certified as operational capable on the B-2 in July 1997. Limited Initial Operational Capability was achieved on the B-52 in December 1998. The B-1B Lancer conventional mission upgrade program is configuring the B-1B to carry out its role as the primary Air Force long-range heavy bomber for conventional warfare. The 11 Feb 1998 drop from a B-1B was the 122nd guided JDAM launch. The depot at Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center will install the modification kits in the initial block of bombers by January 1999, giving Air Combat Command seven JDAM-capable B-1B bombers 18 months ahead of the initial program schedule.
                
Potential Upgrades
                
The JDAM product improvement program may add a terminal seeker for precision guidance and other system improvements to existing JDAMs to provide the Air Force with 3-meter precision and improved anti-jamming capability. The Air Force is evaluating several alternatives and estimates that the seeker could be available for operations by 2004. The seeker kit could be used by both the 2,000-pound blast fragmentation and penetrator JDAMs.
                
The Advanced Unitary Penetrator (AUP), a candidate to be integrated with a GBU-31 guidance kit, is a 2000 lb. class penetrator warhead intended as an upgrade/replacement for the BLU-109 warhead in applications requiring increased penetration. The AUP is designed to provide increased penetration capability over the BLU-109 warhead while maintaining the same overall weight, mass properties, dimensions, and physical interfaces associated with the BLU-109 warhead. This concept integrates the AUP warhead with the GBU-31, the JDAM tail kit for 2,000 lb class warheads. This concept uses the Hard Target Smart Fuze (HTSF), an accelerometer based electronic fuze which allows control of the detonation point by layer counting, distance or time. The accelerometer senses G loads on the bomb due to deceleration as it penetrates through to the target. The fuze can distinguish between earth, concrete, rock and air.
                
The boosted penetrator concept is based on achieving maximum penetration without sacrificing operational flexibility. Total system weight will be less than 2,250 pounds so that it can be carried by all AF tactical aircraft and bombers as well as the Navy&apos;s F/A-18. The goal is to achieve greater penetration than the GBU-28 with a near term, affordable design. A dense metal warhead will be used with a wraparound rocket motor to allow internal carriage in the F-117. Advanced explosives will be used to compensate for the reduced charge weight. This concept integrates the boosted penetrator warhead with a JDAM guidance kit with an adverse weather Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR).
                
The Ballasted Penetrator in GBU-32 concept is a 1000 pound dense or ballasted penetrator integrated with a GBU-32 guidance kit using compressed carriage for internal carriage in advanced fighters (F-22, JSF) or carriage in cruise missiles (JASSM, CALCM, ACM, ATACMS, Tomahawk.) The warhead would either be designed with a dense metal case or contain dense metal ballast for maximum penetration. The warhead will be filled with an advanced insensitive explosive to compensate for the reduced charge weight. The warhead will be integrated with the GBU-32, the JDAM tail kit for 1,000 lb class warheads. The Boosted Unitary Penetrator concept is based on achieving maximum penetration in a weapon that will fit internally in the F-22. Total system weight will be less than 1300 pounds. A dense metal warhead will be used with a wraparound rocket motor. Use of next generation compressed seekers and aerocontrol designs along with reaction jet control will allow the size to shrink sufficiently to fit inside F-22 and JSF. Advanced explosives will be used to compensate for the reduced charge weight. This concept integrates the boosted penetrator warhead with a JDAM guidance kit with an adverse weather Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR).
                
The JDAM/BLU-113 concept improves the GBU-28 by enhancing the nose design of the BLU-113 warhead for improved penetration. The warhead nose reshape will improve BLU-113 penetration by more than 25%. The penetration could potentially be further improved by replacing the traditional HE fill with a dense explosive. The design involves integrating the improved BLU-113 warhead with a JDAM tail kit. The Compressed Carriage GBU-32, J1K, enhanced fill concept is a JAST-1000 warhead with enhanced fill integrated with a GBU-32 guidance kit using compressed carriage for internal carriage in advanced fighters (F-22, JSF) or carriage in cruise missiles (JASSM, CALCM, ACM, ATACMS, Tomahawk.) The warhead is a combined penetrator and blast/fray warhead. The warhead shape is optimized for penetration and the enhanced fill and internal liner provide blast and controlled fragmentation capability. The warhead is shrouded to match the MK-83 mass properties and interfaces. The warhead will be integrated with the GBU-32, the JDAM tail kit for 1,000 lb class warheads. Use of aero-control designs along with reaction jet control will allow the size to shrink sufficiently to fit inside F-22 and JSF. This concept uses the Hard Target Smart Fuze (HTSF).
                
The Direct Attack Munitions Affordable Seeker (DAMASK) Fleet Advanced Demonstration (FAD) accuracy enhancement kit is a seeker of the lowest possible cost that will improve JDAM accuracy to three-meter circular error probability (CEP). The three-year FAD began in FY 98 and continued through FY 00. DAMASK includes a very low-cost sensor mounted to the front of a JDAM and an off-the-shelf signal processor mounted in the existing JDAM tail kit. It uses an uncooled imaging-infrared focal plane array (UIIFPA) sensor and low-cost optics, both developed for the consumer automobile market. An offthe-shelf, commercially available signal processor is the final component of the accuracy upgrade kit, estimated to cost less than $12.7 thousand per seeker in quantity. During the final stages of weapon flight, DAMASK&apos;s unique guidance system will image the target area, locate a mission-planned aim point and update the JDAM target location. The mission-planning image can come from satellite, uninhabited air vehicles or reconnaissance aircraft. A template is then automatically produced from the missionplanning image and loaded on board the aircraft with the baseline JDAM mission plan. Organic targeting is possible because the target area can be imaged with onboard synthetic aperture radar (SAR) or forward looking infrared (FLIR) sensors, and the pilot can then select the desired impact point using a heads-down display.

The Global Positioning System Aided Munition (GAM) was developed by the Air Force and Northrop Grumman Corporation as an interim precision munition for the B-2. GAM is a tail kit that fits on the 2,000-pound Mk84 general purpose bomb [GBU-36/B], or the 4,500 lb BLU-113 penetrator [GBU-37/B]. GAM uses GPS guidance to more accurately guide to target locations. The munition is to be eventually replaced on the B-2 by the Joint Direct Attack Munition. The GBU-37 was added to the B-2 arsenal in late 1997. This weapon is currently the only all-weather, near-precision &quot;bunker busting &quot; capability available.
                
The Global Positioning System (GPS) Aided Target System [GATS] is an all weather B-2 targeting system which reduces Target Location Error (TLE) normally associated with target coordinates. By exploiting the synergistic effects of the B-2&apos;s GPS navigation and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) capabilities, which combine the SAR&apos;s excellent range and range rate capabilities with accurate GPS Position and velocity information, we provide the GAM highly accurate target location relative to current B-2 position.
                
The GATS/GAM system was developed to meet a B-2 Block 20 precision weapon requirement left unfulfilled by the cancellation of another munition. All GAMs have been delivered to the 509th Bomb Wing, Whiteman AFB MO and are in operational use. Demonstrated accuracy by Air Combat Command aircrews has been under 20 feet.

The designation GBU-38(V)/B was allocated to 500 lb class JDAM bombs with guidance kits from Boeing. At least two different types of warhead can be used with the 500 lb JDAM tailkits:
                         
MK 82: Standard 500 lb LDGP (Low-Drag General Purpose) bomb
BLU-111/B: Instead of the MK 82, the BLU-111/B warhead can also be used in the GBU-38/B series JDAMs. The BLU-111/B is externally identical to the MK 82, but uses the PBXN-109 thermally insensitive explosive. The BLU-111A/B and -111C/B variants, used by the Navy, have external protective coating.
BLU-126/B: The BLU-126/B LCDB (Low Collateral Damage Bomb) is externally identical to the BLU-111/B, but is filled with less explosives for a reduced fragmentation pattern blast radius. The LCDB was developed by the U.S. Navy for use in situations where friendly forces and/or civilians are close to the target

The GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) is a 250 lb precision-guided glide bomb that is intended to provide aircraft with the ability to carry a higher number of bombs. Most US Air Force aircraft will be able to carry (using the BRU-61/A rack) a pack of four SDBs in place of a single 2,000 lb bomb.
                
The GBU-39/B is equipped with a GPS-aided inertial navigation system to attack fixed/stationary targets such as fuel depots, bunkers etc.
                
The small size of the bomb allows a single strike aircraft to carry more of the munitions than is possible utilizing currently available bomb units. The SDB carries approximately 38 pounds of AFX-757 high explosive.[citation needed] It also has integrated &quot;DiamondBack&quot; type wings which deploy after release, increasing the glide time and therefore the maximum range. Its size and accuracy allow for an effective munition with less collateral damage.
                
The GBU-39 has a circular error probable (CEP) of 5-8 meters, which means it has a 50% probability of hitting within that distance of its intended target. CEP is reduced by updating differential GPS offsets prior to weapon release. These offsets are calculated using an SDB Accuracy Support Infrastructure, consisting of three or more GPS receivers at fixed locations transmitting calculated location to a correlation station at the theatre Air Operations Center. The corrections are then transmitted by Link 16 to SDB-equipped aircraft.
                
Warhead : AFX-757 Dense Inert Metal Explosive.
Warhead penetration: 3 feet of steel reinforced concrete
Fuze: Electronic safe and fire (ESAF) cockpit selectable functions, including air burst and delayed options.
USAF Designation : GBU-39/B

BLU-133 500 lb (227 kg) bomb. Raytheon&apos;s Enhanced dual-mode GPS and Laser guided version of the laser-only GBU-12.
                
The first version of the GBU-49 is equipped with a guidance kit allowing the use of GPS / INS and / or laser illumination. The second version is an upgrade that also offers the air burst capability, which allows the ammunition to explode at a user-determined height and thus increase the lethality on uncovered troops or weak vehicles Shielded, while keeping GPS / INS and / or Laser guiding types. Accuracy is metric and therefore reduces the risk of collateral damage.
                
The operator has a box in the cabin in which he enters the coordinates of the objective as well as the desired constraints (heading of arrival, slope on impact, height of explosion at impact). This box transfers the information to the ammunition. The operator gets feedback on the firing range. The bomb can be fired at all times on fixed targets (buildings, ammunition or fuel depots, etc.) in GPS / INS mode or, in good weather, in laser guidance on moving or fixed targets.

The GBU-53/B Small Diameter Bomb II is an American air-launched, precision-guided glide bomb.
                
Development was started in 2006 for a 250 pounds (113 kg) class bomb that can identify and strike mobile targets from standoff distances in all weather conditions. It will be integrated on the F-15E and F-35 fighters. Its first flight was announced on May 1, 2009. A contract to start low-rate production was awarded to Raytheon in June 2015.
                
A Boeing/Lockheed Martin team attempted to develop it but lost in a U.S. Air Force competition. Boeing won the original competition but the project was on hold for several years due to a corruption scandal involving Darleen Druyun. The competition was reopened in September 2005.

The Boeing Laser JDAM or LJDAM is a low-cost guidance kit that combines combat-proven JDAM (Joint Direct Attack Munition) GPS/INS-based (Global Positioning System/Inertial Navigation System) navigation with a laser seeker achieving outstanding accuracy. The weapon can be employed to engage both stationary and moving targets on the ground. Boeing developed its LJDAM solution adding a Precision Laser Guidance Set (PLGS) to JDAM guided bombs. The Boeing LJDAM was selected as one of three contenders for the joint United States Air Force (USAF) and United States Navy (USN) Dual Mode Guided Bomb (DMGB) program. The other two contenders were Lockheed Martin&apos;s DMGB and Raytheon&apos;s Enhanced Paveway II (EGBU). The joint services primary goal with the DMGB program was to bring versatility by selecting the optimal guidance mode for a given target without adding more weapon systems to the inventory.
                
The GBU-54 LJDAM was developed adding a laser seeker to the 500-lb GBU-38 JDAM GPS-guided bomb. It allows to engage both stationary and moving targets on the ground with reduced collateral damage thanks to the combination of the 500-lb Mk-82 warhead and the precision strike capability delivered by its dual mode guidance system. The USAF and USN have ordered the GBU-54 guided weapon as part of their efforts during the global war on terror in Iraq and Afghanistan. In July 2008, Germany became its first international customer for the GBU-54.

The Oerlikon 35 mm twin cannon is a towed anti-aircraft gun made by Oerlikon Contraves (renamed as Rheinmetall Air Defence AG following the merger with Rheinmetall in 2009). This twin-barrel 35mm gun has an Fire Control Unit Skyguard that detects and tracks air targets up to 13nm (24km) and computes firing data. The first prototype of this was completed in 1959 under the designation 1 ZLA/353 MK, which was renamed GDF-1. In 1980, the GDF-002 model was introduced. More than 2,000 guns were produced and sold in approximately 30 countries. In 1980, The Oerlikon 35 mm GDF-002 automatic anti-aircraft gun is used primarily as an anti-aircraft weapon but can also be applied against ground targets.
                
In May 1985, the GDF-005 was introduced. This is an overall improvement of the GDF-001/2/3 and the earlier models can be modified to the GDF-005 standard by the use of combat improvement kits supplied by Oerlikon Contraves. The GDF-005 features a new autonomous gun sighting system, an onboard power supply system, an automatic reload and other improvements.
                
Later, the GDF-005 was upgraded with AHEAD system, and named GDF-007. AHEAD technology, developed by Oerlikon Contraves improves the capability of air defense guns such to engage and destroy aerial targets, from large aircraft to small targets such as missiles or PGMs (Precision-Guided Munition ). With the addition of AHEAD modernization, existing Skyguard fire are fitted with the fire control subsystems which enable the system to be operated as a stand-alone gun or in a &quot;fire unit network&quot;, separated up to three kilometers from each other.

It is based on the Leopard 1 tank hull with a large fully rotating turret carrying the armamenta pair of 35 mm Oerlikon KDA autocannons and the two radar dishesa general search radar at the rear of the turret and the tracking radar at the front between the guns.
                
The guns are 90 calibres (3.15 m) long, with a muzzle velocity of 1,400 m/s (FAPDS rounds), giving an effective range of 5,500 m. The KDA autocannon can take two different ammunition types, and the usual loading is a mix of 320 AA and 20 AP rounds per gun. Combined rate of fire is 1,100 rounds/min.
                
The electrically driven turret is powered by a 40 kW generator driven by a 4-cylinder, 3.8 litre Mercedes-Benz OM 314 multi-fuel engine.
                
A missile system upgrade, which mounts the U.S. Stinger surface-to-air missile to the autocannon is in development; since the eighties it had already been common for Stinger teams to accompany the Gepard units, to allow them to take advantage of their long-range scanning capacity.
                
The Gepard was developed from 1963 onwards. In 1969 construction began of four A prototypes testing both 30 and 35 mm guns. On 25 June 1970 it was decided to use the 35 mm type. In 1971 twelve second phase B prototypes were ordered; the same year the Dutch army ordered a CA preseries of five vehicles based on a parallel development that had used a German 0-series Leopard 1 vehicle made available by the German government in March 1970 as the C-prototype. The Germans made a small preseries of both the B1and B2R. On 5 February 1973 the political decision was made to produce the type; in September 1973 the contract was signed with Krauss-Maffei for 432 B2 turrets and 420 hulls with a total value of DM1,200,000,000. Each vehicle would thus be about three times more expensive than a normal Leopard 1. The first was delivered in December 1976. Belgium ordered 55 vehicles, identical to the German version. The Dutch ordered three batches, the CA1, CA2 and CA3 with in total 95 vehicles, equipped with Philips radar systems.

The first prototype, the P.1127, flew in October 1960. Great technical difficulties had to be overcome until 1962 using five additional aircraft. An additional nine planes, the Kestrels, began testing in Mach 1964. Six of them were sent to the US, but development in Britian continued. The tactical version first flew in August 1966, the Gr.1, which entered RAF service in 1969 with the Pegasus Mk102. The later Mk3 uses the more powerful Pegasus Mk103 engine and improved systems including a laser range finder and marked target seeker in a &quot;chisel&quot; nose. A total of 120 GR Mk3s were delivered to the RAF.
In 1969, the US ordered 12 Mk50s (US version AV-8A, for the Marines, then increased the order to 110 aircraft with 8 two seat trainers. In 1975, the Royal Navy ordered the improved Sea Harrier FR5 Mk1 with a fighter cockpit, radar and more powerful engine. Spain ordered 11 Av-8As and two trainers in 1976. US interest eventually developed the AV-8B, a new version by McDonnel Douglas, and ordered the RAF as the Harrier Mk5.

This variant of the Hummer is very similar to the basic model. The only real difference is that this version is a little longer, allowing up to four loaded stretchers to be placed inside, depending upon the exact configuration of the vehicle.

The Hsiung Feng II (HF-2) ("Brave Wind II&quot;) is an anti-ship missile system developed by the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology in Taiwan. The HF-2 is designed to be deployed aboard ships or at facilities on land. An airborne version has also been developed which can be carried by the ROC Air Force's F-CK fighters. The HF-2 has ECCM capabilities and is deployed on the ROC Navy's Cheng Kung class frigates and Lafayette class frigates, as well as at several land-based sites. In 2000, plans were announced to replace the HF-2 missiles stationed on the Cheng Kung frigates with the RGM-84 Harpoon, but the budget for this was cancelled.
        
There are three major versions of HF-2 in service. The first to enter service is the ship-based HF-2, with 2 twin box launcher on destroyer DD-915 first as a trial vessel. Later all major surface combatant in RoCN, except the Knox, were equipped with 2 quad-launchers, plus the 7 WWII era Gearing DDGs that was upgraded to WC3 standard, from the late 1980s to mid-1990s, had added a 1 quad-launcher by mid-1990s to give those air defense ships an anti-surface ability.
           
An air-launched version appeared in the early 1990s. Carried by two AT-3B trainer/attacker and a single A-3 attacker, the small force poses little threat to the marine intruders due to its small quantity. However, the recent upgraded IDF (F-CK-1C/D) will add the capacity to carry and launch the HF-2, thus greatly enhance the air-to-surface capacity of RoCAF in future. The air launcher version of HF-2 carried by AT-3 is different from the one supposed carried by original IDF (F-CK-1A/B) prototype, due to differences in length of the HF-2 missile (better known as HF-2 Mark 3 and Mark 4), where the rocket designed for one aircraft cannot fit on another aircraft. Unknown if air-launched HF-2 program is continuing at this point.
        
The land-launch version of the HF-2 is the most secretive one because of its relation with the land-attack version of HF-2E. Fixed base versions were produced first, and all major outlying islands of Taiwan were equipped with fortified HF-2 bases in the late 1990s, replacing old HF-1 bases. Fixed HF-1 bases in the main island were also being replaced with fixed HF-2 launchers, again in fortified positions.
         
The mobile launcher version was accepted in 2005 and went to mass production in 2006. All mobile launchers, together with mobile command center (with data-link), mobile surface search radar and portable electric generators, were kept in harden shelters and being driven out when needed. The HF-2 mobile launchers, shown in 10-10-2007 parade, was designed to be able to carry both HF-2 and the new HF-3 AShM, by leaving room for the larger HF-3 missile boxes. Same was done to the OH Perry/Cheng Kung class frigate's new HF-2 launchers after each frigate's major overhaul, starting 2001, that allows the launcher to carry larger HF-3 AShM, besides HF-2. Ching Chiang class patrol ship (total 12 built) also are undergoing the same upgrade to carry 2x2 HF-2/3 anti-ship missiles. Kuang Hua VI class missile boat (31 to be built) also carry 2x2 HF-2 anti-ship missile.
       
A submarine-launched version was planned and designed in the mid-1990s, but nothing more was heard. Selling of the UGM-84 by the US in 2001 may probably terminate it. Not confirm of any submarine-launched version exist, nor US had sold any UGM-84 Harpoon to this date, or Taiwan has announced any purchase of sub Harpoon, or any submarine-launched HF-2.

This pioneering turbojet-powered tactical light bomber is often regarded as the Soviet counterpart to an epoch-making British type, the English Electric Canberra. It is an interesting insight into the comparative nature of the British and Soviet aviation industries in the period after World War II (1939-45). However, the design of the Il-28 was started 18 months later than that of the Canberra, but the first prototype of the Soviet bomber then recorded its initial flight during July 1949, some nine months earlier than the British bomber.
At the time of the Il-28&apos;s genesis, the rival Tupolev design bureau was producing a stream of bomber prototypes, so considerable effort had to be made in an attempt to match Tupolev&apos;s more advanced schedule and yet produce a type offering performance superior to that of any rival Tupolev type. The Ilyushin design team opted for an all-metal structure for its bomber, which accommodated a three-man crew in separate positions in the circular-section fuselage. It also carried the twin-wheel nose unit of the tricycle landing gear, the fuel and the weapon bay, and supported the tail unit and the high-set wing. The tail unit comprised swept vertical and horizontal surfaces, but the wing was straight and carried two underslung nacelles for the landing gear&apos;s single-wheel main units and the two VK-1A turbojets.
The VK-1A was a Soviet development of the RD-45, itself a Soviet copy of the British Rolls-Royce Nene centrifugal-flow turbojet, and was one of the keys to the Il-28&apos;s excellent performance.
       
In October 1948, the Il-28 was evaluated against the Tupolev Tu-78, emerged as superior on all major counts, and was therefore rushed into production for service from September 1950. Construction is thought to have totaled some 3,000 aircraft, of which more than half were exported to the U.S.S.R.&apos;s Warsaw Pact allies, China (at least 500 aircraft), and many other countries. The Il-28 was also licensed for production in China as the Harbin H-5 (see below), and in small numbers in Czechoslovakia as the B-228.
Despite its obsolescence in the basic light bomber role, the Il-28 remains in fairly widespread, although small-scale service with allies and clients of the late U.S.S.R.
The Il-28 was also developed in a three-seat tactical reconnaissance variant (not the Il-28R as often supposed), the erstwhile weapons bay being used to accommodate between three and five cameras plus some 12 to 18 photoflash bombs, or, in an alternative radar reconnaissance form, the weapon bay replaced by a large radar installation. Some aircraft have an electronic reconnaissance package with a radome under the rear fuselage, and other aircraft of this series have been adapted for the target-towing, meteorological reconnaissance, nuclear detonation atmospheric sampling and, as a last step, unmanned missile target roles.

The IL-76M is a massive transport that improved the capabilities of the former Soviet transport fleet in much the same way that the C-130 benefited the U.S. and its allies. The Candid is capable of operating in any weather, from the freezing cold of Siberia to the blistering heat of the Middle East. While the armed versions of this aircraft pose virtually no threat in aerial combat, they present a considerable strategic danger because of the amount of men, equipment and cargo that they can move. These behemoths are capable of transporting up to 140 troops, or wheeled or tracked vehicles, or up to 44 tons of cargo. As a result, these aircraft are major targets that should be destroyed at every opportunity.

The new missile is an accurate supersonic, long-range air-to-ground assault missile with a warhead, rocket engine and advanced navigation suit which allows for precision targeting at a very low mission cost compared to existing solutions.
           
Early, Boaz Levy, General Manager and Executive Vice President of IAIs Rockets and Space Group told Janes that: Rampage is a supersonic all-weather day/night ASM with a stand-off range of 100s of kilometers.
          
Among the missile features are its ability to control and monitor the extent of its shrapnel, which will make its strike surgical, accurate and with minimum collateral damage despite the fact the missile spends a lot of time in the air from the minute it is launched until it strikes its target.
        
The missile adjusted to all offense platforms including the Israeli air force F-15, F-16 and F-35 fighter jets and should be used against anti-aircraft batteries, enemys headquarters, armament storages, and logistic bases among others.

The Iowa-class battleships were a class of six fast battleships ordered by the United States Navy in 1939 and 1940 to escort the Fast Carrier Task Forces that would operate in the Pacific Theater of World War II. Four were completed, two more were laid down but canceled in August 1945, at war&apos;s end, and both hulls were scrapped in 1958. Like other third-generation American battleships, the Iowas followed the design pattern set forth in the preceding North Carolina-class and South Dakota-class battleships, which emphasized speed in addition to secondary and anti-aircraft batteries. Based on wartime experience, they were to serve as fast escorts for Essex-class aircraft carriers.
                
Between the mid-1940s and the early 1990s, the Iowa-class battleships fought in four major US wars. In World War II, they defended aircraft carriers and shelled Japanese positions. During the Korean War, the battleships provided seaborne artillery support for United Nations forces fighting North Korea, and in 1968, New Jersey shelled Viet Cong and Vietnam People&apos;s Army forces in the Vietnam War. All four were reactivated and modernized at the direction of Congress in 1981, and armed with missiles during the 1980s, as part of the 600-ship Navy initiative. During Operation Desert Storm in 1991, Missouri and Wisconsin fired missiles and 16-inch (406 mm) guns at Iraqi targets.

IRIS-T (infra-red imaging system - tail / thrust vector controlled) is an air-to-air guided missile manufactured by Diehl BGT Defence as part of a Germany-led multinational program that started in 1995. The missile is intended to replace AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles used by the NATO member countries.
                
The IRIS-T entered service in December 2005 with the air forces of participating program nations including Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, Sweden and Spain. The export customers of the IRIS-T are Austria, South Africa, Saudi Arabia and Thailand.
                
In comparison to the AIM-9L Sidewinder, the IRIS-T has higher ECM-resistance and flare suppression. Improvements in target discrimination not only allows for 5 to 8 times longer head-on firing range than the AIM-9L, it can also engage targets behind the launching aircraft, the latter made possible by the extreme close-in agility allowing turns of 60 g at a rate of 60°/s.
                
The Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF) has tested a new air-to-surface capability developed by Diehl BGT Defence for the IRIS-T. A proof of concept test firing to acquire, track, and engage a target representing a small fast attack boat was conducted in Norway in September 2016, where the IRIS-T missile was launched from an RNoAF F-16AM multirole aircraft. For the air-to-surface role, the missile retains the same standard IRIS-T AAM hardware configuration, including the HE warhead and IIR guidance package, with only an updated software insertion required to deliver the additional ground attack capability. This basic air-to-ground capability provides the ability to acquire, track and engage individual ground targets like boats/ships, small buildings and vehicles.
                
In addition, the IRIS-T has the unique ability, in comparison to other similar missiles such as the AIM-9X, to target and shoot down other air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles. In fact, a surface launched variant of the IRIS-T the IRIS-T SL actually has even further enhanced capabilities capable of destroying aircraft, helicopters, cruise missiles, air-to-surface missiles, anti-ship missiles, anti-radar rockets and large-calibre rockets. It also has high probability of a killing shot against UAVs and other small maneuvering threats at very-short and medium-range distances.

The design of the MiG-17 was undertaken to correct the deficiencies that the earlier MiG-15 had at higher speeds. It was the first Soviet fighter to have an afterburning engine, the Klimov VK-1.
In 1949, the Mikoyan-Guryevich (MiG) design bureau began work on a new fighter to replace the MiG-15. Two features of the aircraft were a thinner wing of greater sweep and a redesigned tail that improved stability and handling at speeds approaching Mach 1. Although similar in appearance to the MiG-15, the MiG-17 has more sharply swept wings, an afterburner, better speed and handling characteristics and is about three feet longer. The wings of the aircraft are mid-mounted, swept-back, and tapered with blunt tips. They have wide wing roots. The engine is one turbojet inside the body and has a round air intake in the nose. It has a single, small exhaust. The fuselage is short, thick, cigar-shaped and tapered to the rear. It has a blunt nose and bubble canopy. The tail fin is swept-back and tapered with rounded tip. Flats are high-mounted on the tail fin, swept-back, and tapered. Flats and fin overhang the exhaust.
The MiG-17 served with nearly 30 air forces worldwide, including the Soviet Union, Warsaw Pact countries, China, Afghanistan, North Korea, Sri Lanka, Syria, Morocco, Cuba, Indonesia, and Cambodia. Though smaller than the USAF F-86 Sabre of Korean War fame, its weight and performance favorably compared to that aircraft. Soviet production of the MiG-17 ended in 1958 with over 6,000 produced. It continued to be built under license in Poland as the Lim-5P and in China as the J-5/F-4. China&apos;s first reproduced jet fighter plane, the J-5, successfully flew in Shenyang for the first time on July 19th 1956.

The Shenyang J-5 is a Chinese-built single-seat jet interceptor and fighter aircraft derived from the Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17. The J-5 was exported as the F-5[3] and was originally designated Dongfeng-101 (East Wind-101) and also Type 56 before being designated J-5 in 1964.
        
The MiG-17 was license-built in China and Poland into the 1960s. The People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) obtained a number of Soviet-built MiG-17 Fresco-A day fighters, designated J-4 in the early 1950s. To introduce modern production methods to Chinese industry the PLAAF obtained plans for the MiG-17F Fresco-C day fighter in 1955, along with two completed pattern aircraft, 15 knockdown kits, and parts for ten aircraft. The first Chinese-built MiG-17F, (serialed Zhong 0101), produced by the Shenyang factory, performed its initial flight on 19 July 1956 with test pilot Wu Keming at the controls.
      
Plans were obtained in 1961 for the MiG-17PF interceptor and production began, as the J-5A (F-5A), shortly afterwards. At this time the Sino-Soviet split occurred, causing much disruption to industrial and technical projects, so the first J-5A did not fly until 1964, when the type was already obsolete. A total of 767 J-5s and J-5As had been built when production ended in 1969.
       
The Chinese also built a two-seat trainer version of the MiG-17, designated the Chengdu JJ-5 (Jianjiji Jiaolianji - Fighter Trainer - FT-5), from 1968, by combining the two-seat cockpit of the MiG-15UTI, the VK-1A engine of the J-5, and the fuselage of the J-5A. All internal armament was deleted and a single Nudelman-Richter NR-23 23 mm cannon was carried in a ventral pack. Production of the JJ-5 reached 1,061 when production ceased in 1986, with the type exported to a number of countries.

The Shenyang J-6  is the Chinese-built version of the Soviet MiG-19 'Farmer' fighter aircraft, the world's first mass-produced supersonic aircraft.
           
The J-6 was considered &quot;disposable&quot; and was intended to be operated for only 100 flight hours (or approximately 100 sorties) before being overhauled. The Pakistan Air Force was often able to extend this to 130 hours with diligent maintenance.

The J-7 III is the Chinese equivalent of the MiG-21MF. Substantially reworked from the J-7 II, the J-7 III&apos;s first flight occurred on April 26th, 1984. Jointly developed by Chengdu and Guizhou (GAIC), the J-7 III entered PLA Air Force and Navy service beginning in 1992, with production continuing thereafter.
By 1989, Chinese production was running at a rate of as much as 14 aircraft per month, primarily for export. The J-7 aircraft was the most widely produced Chinese fighter, replacing older J-6 fighters, the Chinese version of the MiG-19. In 1995, it was projected that J-7 production would continue for at least another decade, resulting in a total inventory of nearly 1000 aircraft by 2005, but in fact the PLAAF inventory has remained static since then at about 500 aircraft, suggesting that production has either been suspended or terminated.

The J-8 was the first PLAAF aircraft of domestic design, with design work beginning in 1964. The overall configuration is a rather straightforward enlargement of the MiG-21/J-7 layout to accommodate two engines. Although it resembled Mikoyan&apos;s experimental Ye-152A, contrary to some early reports, it was not based on that aircraft. Production began in December 1979, with about 100-150 units of the first configuration entering service. Design work on the improved J-8-2 began in 1980, with production beginning in the late 1980s. Like the cancelled &quot;Super 7&quot; upgrade to the single-engine J-7, the J-8-2 completely reworks the front end of the aircraft, adding much larger radar and ventral air inlets, along with various other less pronounced improvements. The best that can be said of the J-8 is that, once upgraded, it will be no more than an advanced obsolete aircraft, comparable in configuration and aerodynamic performance to the Su-15 &quot;Flagon&quot;.

PLAAF SU-27 with downgrade avonics and AG capability.
      
The J-11 was finally born in 1998 as a Chinese version of the Soviet-designed Sukhoi Su-27SK air superiority fighter after China secured a $US2.5 billion production agreement which licensed China to build 200 Su-27SK aircraft using Russian-supplied kits. Under the terms of the agreement, these aircraft would be outfitted with Russian avionics, radars and engines. However, in 2004, Russian media reported that Shenyang co-production of the basic J-11 was halted after around 100 examples were built. The PLAAF later revealed a mock-up of an upgraded multi-role version of the J-11 in mid-2002. The indigenous J-11B variant incorporates various Chinese material modifications and upgrades to the airframe with improved manufacturing methods in addition to the inclusion of domestic Chinese technologies such as radar, avionics suites and weaponry including anti-ship and PL-12 air-to-air missiles presumably for the role of a maritime strike aircraft. The alleged reason for the sudden stop in the production line of the J-11 was because it could no longer satisfy the PLAAF's requirements, due to elements such as the obsolete avionics and radar, which were structured for aerial missions.

The Shenyang J-15, NATO reporting name: Flanker-X2, also known as Flying Shark, is a 4th generation, twin-jet, all-weather, carrier-based fighter aircraft in development by the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation and the 601 Institute for the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy's aircraft carriers. It is developed from J-11B as well as from studying of a prototype of Su-33. An unfinished Su-33 prototype, the T-10K-3, was acquired from Ukraine in 2001 and is said to have been studied extensively, reverse engineered, with development on the J-15 beginning immediately afterward. While the J-15 appears to be structurally based on the prototype of Su-33, the indigenous fighter features Chinese technologies as well as avionics from the J-11B program. In February 2018, discussions about replacing the aircraft appeared in several Chinese media outlets including Xinhua and China's main military newspaper, discussing that it belongs to the 4th or 4.5 generation fighters. Thus, the J-15 is viewed as an interim carrier-based fighter until a 5th generation successor enters service, one that may be based on the J-20 or J-31.

The Saab 37 Viggen (Swedish: Thunderbolt, but can also mean &quot;the Tufted Duck&quot;) was a Swedish single-seat, single-engine, short-medium range fighter aircraft and attack aircraft, manufactured between 1970 and 1990. Several variants were produced to perform the roles of all-weather fighter-interceptor, ground attack, and photo-reconnaissance, as well as a two-seat trainer.
                
The Viggen was initially developed as a replacement for the Saab 32 Lansen in the attack role and later the Saab 35 Draken as a fighter.[1] The first studies were carried out between 1952 and 1957 involving the legendary Finnish aircraft designer Aarne Lakomaa. Several different concepts were studied involving both single- and twin engines and also with separate lift engines, both simple and double delta wings and also with canard wings. Even VTOL designs were considered. The aim was to produce a robust aircraft with good short-runway performance that could be operated from numerous specially prepared roads and highways to reduce the vulnerability to attack in the event of war. Other requirements included supersonic ability at low level, Mach 2 performance at altitude, and the ability to make short landings at low angles of attack (to avoid damaging improvised runways).
                
To meet these design goals, Saab selected a radical configuration: a conventional delta wing with small, high-set canard wings. Canards have since become common in fighter aircraft, notably with the Eurofighter Typhoon and the IAI Kfir, but mainly for agility reasons rather than STOL capabilities. The final proposal was presented and accepted on 28 September 1962. Construction started in 1964, with a first prototype maiden flight on 8 February 1967.
                
The aircraft was also designed from the beginning to be easy to repair and service, even for personnel without much training.
                
In 1960 the U.S. National Security Council, led by President Eisenhower, formulated a military security guarantee for Sweden. The U.S. promised to help Sweden militarily in case of a Soviet attack against Sweden. As a consequence of this Sweden and the U.S. signed a military-technology agreement. In what was known as the &quot;37-annex&quot;, Sweden was allowed access to advanced U.S. aeronautical technology which made it possible to design and produce the Saab 37 Viggen much faster and cheaper than would otherwise have been possible.
                
The reason for this officially unexplained U.S. support was, according to the doctoral research of Nils Bruzelius at the Swedish National Defence College, the need to protect U.S. Polaris submarines deployed just outside the Swedish west coast against the threat of Soviet anti-submarine aircraft.

French/British low-altitude ground attack aircraft. The French and British air forces each bought around 200; the Jaguar also did well on the export market. The Jaguar is a relative small aircraft with a tiny shoulder-wing, giving a smooth &apos;ride&apos; at low altitude. It is not very sophisticated, but versatile and effective, and upgrade programs are now extending its capabilities. The British versions are the S attack aircraft (Jaguar GR) and the B two-seat trainer (Jaguar T). The Jaguar A is the French attack version, and the E the French two-seat trainer. The Jaguar M shipboard attack aircraft was cancelled. The Jaguar International is the export version; it is being license-built in India.

The Type 055 JiangWei class frigate - sometimes also referred to as Anqing class - was China´s first patrol ship with anti-submarine capability. It represents a shift in Chinese naval doctrine from ships operating close to shore towards ocean-going vessels.
                
JiangWei class vessels are armed with CY-1 anti-submarine missiles as main weapon. Additionally, they can carry a helicopter and C-802 anti-ship missiles. The JiangWei class has, however, not really a anti-ship capability.

The JP-233 has two kinds of sub-munitions: the SG 357, an anti-runway bomblet, and the HB 876, an area denial mine.
The SG 357 penetrates the runway surface before exploding and craters the tarmac. The HB 876 mines scatter around the area and delay repair works.
The JP-233 requires that the target area be overflown at low-level, making the deploying aircraft vulnerable to AAA and MANPADS.
The JP.233 sub-munitions are now prohibited under the Ottawa Protocol that bans the use of landmines.

The K2 Black Panther main battle tank evolved from the XK2 programme. This next-generation MBT was developed in South Korea using indigenous technology only. Its development began in 1995. First prototype was revealed in 2007. Since then this tank was trialed and evaluated. Production contract for the first 100 K2 tanks was signed in 2014. In 2016 this first batch of 100 tanks was reportedly delivered and additional tanks were being built. South Korean Army has a requirement for around 300 of these new tanks. Eventually the K2 Black Panther will replace the older K1 main battle tanks.
                
Currently the K2 is one of the most advanced main battle tank in the world, outclassing anything North Korea or China have. Furthermore it is the most expensive main battle tank to date, overtaking the Japanese Type 90 MBT.
                
This tank uses both modular composite armor of undisclosed type and Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA) blocks. It is claimed that front armor withstands direct hits from 120 mm tank rounds, fired from L55 guns. The Black Panther tank is also completed with an active protection system and countermeasures system. The tank is also completed with an NBC protection system.
                
Protection of the K2 is broadly similar to the M1A2 Abrams MBT considering that the K2 is significantly lighter. It is claimed that the K2 is superior to the M1A2 Abrams.
                
The Black Panther is armed with a Rheinmetall 120 mm/L55 smoothbore gun. This gun is license-produced in South Korea. The K2 is completed with an automatic loader. This MBT has a maximum rate of fire in 15 rounds per minute. It is worth mentioning that autoloader&apos;s is similar to that, used on the French Leclerc main battle tank. A total of 16 rounds are stored in the autoloader. Remaining 24 rounds are stored inside the hull.
                
It also has a very advanced fire control system, allowing to track and engage not only the main battle tanks, but low-flying helicopters as well. Maximum effective range of fire is up to 10 kilometers. Furthermore its fire control system can spot, track and fire automatically at visible vehicle-size targets without needing any input from a human operator.
                
The 120 mm gun can fire variety of munitions. It is compatible with all standard NATO tank rounds. It is also capable of firing the new KSTAM (Korean Smart Top-Attack Munition) rounds. These are smart target-activated fire-and-forget projectiles, but shouldn&apos;t be confused with anti-tank guided missiles. The KSTAM has its own guidance system, aided by four stabilizing fins. At the final stage a parachute will deploy to slow its fall and accurately engage target. Such principle is broadly similar to mortar-launched anti-tank munitions. Furthermore the K-2 tank can fire KSTAM munitions from behind the cover. The KSTAM has a maximum effective range of 8 kilometers.
                
Secondary armament consists of coaxial 7.62 mm machine gun and K6 12.7 mm heavy machine gun, mounted on top of the roof. Both of these machine gun have a very respectable ammunition load (12 000 x 7.62 mm and 3 200 x 12.7 mm). Furthermore the K6 heavy machine gun has an automatic system, that identifies friend from a foe.
                
This main battle tank has a crew of three, including commander, gunner and driver.
                
Other features of the K2 tank include digital battlefield management system and navigation system for rapid coordination. The K2 can rapidly report combat situation, thus increasing situational awareness of friendly forces.
                
The Korean K2 is powered by the license-built MTU MB-883 Ka500 engine, developing 1 500 horsepower. There is also an auxiliary gas-turbine power unit, developing 400 horsepower. It powers onboard systems when the main engine is turned off. The K2 Black Panther has a state-of-the-art semi-active hydropneumatic suspension. Every boogie wheel can be individually controlled, allowing this MBT to &quot;sit&quot;, &quot;stand&quot;, &quot;kneel&quot; or to &quot;lean&quot; in any direction. This feature gives tank a number of advantages, furthermore it is claimed that such suspension system is easier to maintain, comparing with traditional one.
                
The Black Panther tank is fitted with a deep wading kit. It enables vehicle to cross rivers and other water obstacles up to 4.2 meters deep. Previous K1 and K1A1 MBTs lacked this feature.
                
Price of the K2 tank is $7.5 Million. It is also being offered for export customers. Turkey has successfully negotiated import or license production of the K2 subsystems. The new Turkish Altay MBT uses some technologies of the K2 Black Panther MBT.

Able to fire 1,000 rounds/min. against ground targets or 3,000 rounds/min against enemy aircraft, the M-163 is definitely not something you want to take lightly. This vehicle is essentially a M113 chassis with a Vulcan turret on it. The M-163 has considerable range, up to 3,280 yards against ground targets and 2,843 yards against aircraft. Additionally, this vehicle carries 2,100 rounds of various types of ammo and can limit its fire to 10-100 round bursts, which prevents it from running out of ammo quickly.
                
M-167 Vulcan
The M-167 is a trailer-mounted, towed variant of this anti-aircraft system.

The KAB-500Kr (Correctable air bomb - 500 kg) is an electro-optical TV-guided fire and forget bomb developed by the Soviet Air Force in the 1980s. It remains in service with the CIS and various export customers.
           
The KAB-500Kr is analogous to the American GBU-15 weapon. It uses a standard Soviet/Russian FAB-500 general-purpose bomb, with a nominal weight of 500 kg (1,100 lb), as a warhead, adding a low-light television seeker and guidance fins to turn it into a guided, unpowered glide bomb.
           
The bomb is 3.05 m (10.0 ft) long and weighs 520 kg (1,150 lb), of which 380 kg (840 lb) is a hardened, armor-piercing warhead capable of penetrating up to 1.5 metres (4 feet 11 inches) of reinforced concrete. The weapon's seeker can lock onto a target at ranges of up to 15 to 17 km (9.3 to 10.6 mi), depending on visibility. The KAB-500-OD variant is equipped with a fuel-air explosive warhead. The technology of KAB-500Kr is also used for larger bombs, such as KAB-1500Kr based on the 1500 kg class FAB-1500 iron bomb. There is also training bomb KAB-500Kr-U.
The KAB-500S-E is a version with satellite guidance.

The KAB-500L is a laser-guided bomb developed by the Soviet Air Force. It remains in service with the CIS and post-Soviet Russian Air Force.
          
The KAB-500L is a standard FAB-500 general-purpose bomb, which has a nominal weight of 500 kg (1,100 lb), fitted with a semi-active laser seeker and guidance fins, turning it into an unpowered guided bomb.
            
The KAB-500L is 3.05 m (10.0 ft) long and weighs 525 kg (1,157 lb). Its warhead makes up 450 kg (990 lb) of the total weight, of which roughly 50% is blast-effect high explosive. Russian sources credit it with a CEP of 7 meters (23 feet). The technology of KAB-500L is also used for larger bombs, such as the KAB-1500L family.
           
It is also deployed by the Indian Air Force. The primary launch platform is Su-30MKI.

KAB-1500 is a Russian precision guided weapon which comes in three versions: KAB-1500L, KAB-1500S-E and TV-guided KAB-1500KR.
       
KAB-1500L is a Russian precision guided weapon, part of KAB-1500 family, a laser guided bomb and also the current production standard for use on 4+ and 4++ generation fighter jets, like the Sukhoi Su-30MKI/Sukhoi Su-30MKK, Sukhoi Su-34 and Sukhoi Su-35. It is claimed to be the Russian equivalent to USA's Paveway II/Paveway III and is designed to hit railway, ammunition depots, railway terminals, highway bridges, military and industrial facilities, ships and transport vessels. The KAB-1500LG-F-E has an impact fuze which includes 3 different delay modes for target attack and it can also be mounted on older aircraft, like the Sukhoi Su-24 and the Mikoyan MiG-27.
        
The bomb has been used in the Russian military campaigns in Chechnya and Syria

Russian laser-guided bombs are functionally equivalent to their U.S. counterparts. The weapons are, perhaps, an even greater force multiplier to Russian-supplied air forces than they are to Western air forces. This is because Russian aircraft lack sophisticated bombing computers that can provide pinpoint accuracy even without laser-guidance.

The KC-10 Extender first flew on 12 July 1980, but it was not until October the same year that the first aerial refuel sortie was performed. The design for the KC-10 involved modifications from the DC-10-30CF design. Unnecessary airline features were replaced by an improved cargo-handling system and military avionics. Meanwhile, the KC-10 retains 88% commonality with its commercial counterparts, giving it greater access to the worldwide commercial support system. Other changes from the DC-10-30CF include the removal of most windows and lower cargo doors. Early aircraft featured a distinctive light gray, white and blue paint scheme, but a gray-green camouflage scheme was used on later tankers. The paint scheme was switched to a medium gray color by the late 1990s.
A jet aircraft refuels from a gray three-engine tanker via a long boom located under the tanker's aft fuselage.
The KC-10's mixed refueling system of hose-and-drogue and flying-boom allows it to refuel the aircraft of the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps and allied forces.
        
The most notable changes were the addition of the McDonnell Douglas Advanced Aerial Refueling Boom (AARB) and additional fuel tanks located in the baggage compartments below the main deck. The extra tanks increase the KC-10's fuel capacity to 356,000 lb (161,478 kg), nearly doubling the KC-135's capacity. The KC-10 has both a centerline refueling boomunique in that it sports a control surface system at its aft end that differs from the V-tail design used on previous tankersand a drogue-and-hose system on the starboard side of the rear fuselage. The KC-10 boom operator is located in the rear of the aircraft with a wide window for monitoring refueling. The operator controls refueling operations through a digital fly-by wire system.
         
Unlike the KC-135, the KC-10's hose-and-drogue system allows refueling of Navy, Marine Corps, and most allied aircraft, all in one mission. The final twenty KC-10s produced included wing-mounted pods for added refueling locations. The KC-10 can also carry a complement of 75 personnel with 146,000 lb (66,225 kg) of cargo, or 170,000 lb (77,110 kg) in an all-cargo configuration.[6] The KC-10 has a side cargo door for loading and unloading cargo. Handling equipment is required to raise and lower loads to the cargo opening. It can carry cargo and serve as a tanker on overseas missions.

This modified DC-10 is always a welcome sight to friendly fighter pilots. The KC-10 is a large gas station in the sky, capable of refueling 3 aircraft simultaneously at the rate of 420 gallons per minute from its 356,065-lb. store of fuel. Alternately, it can use its tanks to travel literally halfway around the world. Furthermore, the Extender can also be used as a cargo transport, capable of moving an astounding 169,409 lbs. of cargo per trip. Unfortunately, the KC-10 is a sitting duck in the air, exploding into a giant fireball if it takes even a minor hit in the wrong place. These crafts should never travel in hostile areas without an escort.

While the KC-135 only carries about two-thirds the fuel load of a KC-10 (203,288 lbs.), it is nonetheless a valuable aid in extending the effective range of other aircraft. The engines, fuel loads and structures of the Stratotankers have recently been upgraded. These upgrades add an estimated 27,000 hours of service life to each craft, thus making them useful to at least the year 2020.

The Block 50/52 is the current production version of the F-16 Fighting Falcon. It features the Improved Performance Engines, either the F110-GE-129 for the Block 50 or the F100-PW-229 for the Block 52. The F100-PW-229 is lighter and more powerful than earlier F100s.
This version first appeared in late 1990. Production of this version is still ongoing and will be expanded well beyond 2005 with the latest aircraft delivered to Greece and Israel
                
The Block 50/52&apos;s have the capability to fire the AIM-120 Amraam, the new AGM-65G Maverick missile and the PGU-28/B 20mm cannon round. The Block 50/52 is capable of carrying the new JDAM munition, the AGM-145A/B JSOW and is the first F-16 version to integrate the AGM-84 Harpoon antishipping missile. The AGM-137 TSSAM stand-off attack missile was also foreseen in its weaponry, but subsequently cancelled. The aircraft can launch the Harpoon in line-of-sight, bearing-only, and range/bearing modes. The addition of the Harpoon gives the F-16 a significant standoff range anti-shipping capability, especially when combined with optional 600-gallon fuel tanks.
                
The F-16CJ/DJ Block 50D/52D have the HARM avionics/Launcher Interface Computer (ALIC) resulting in a full autonomous employment capability of the HARM missile. This capability adds the SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses) mission to the already extensive list of missions the F-16 is capable to perform.
Two HARM missiles are normally carried on a typical SEAD mission.

The Kidd-class destroyers were a series of four guided missile destroyers (DDGs) based on the Spruance class. In contrast to their predecessor's focus on anti-submarine warfare, the Kidds were designed as more advanced multipurpose ships with the addition of considerably enhanced anti-aircraft capabilities. Originally ordered for the former Imperial Iranian Navy, the contracts were canceled when the 1979 Iranian Revolution began, and the ships were completed for the United States Navy. They were decommissioned in 1999 and sold to the Republic of China Navy as the Kee Lung class.

The KMGU-2 dispenser was created in USSR in the 70s and 80s and was a response to the NATO MW-1 mine dispensers. It was designed to deploy lightweight bombs against large flat target such as runways, parking ramps, railway lines, roads, artillery positions and others. KMGU-2 has a cigar shaped fuselage with a hermetic compartment for packs of bombs in the center. In cruise flight the compartment is closed by movable flaps. Bombs are mounted in BKF blocks. In one dispenser there is room for 8 packs of 12 - 256 lightweight bombs. Bombs can be dropped at speeds between 700 and 1200km/h and at altitudes between 50 and 1500m. KMGU-2 dispensers were delivered with Su-22 (4xKMGU-2), Su-24, Su-25 (8xKMGU-2), MiG 27 (4xKMGU-2) and MiG 29 (4xKMGU-2). KMGU-2 dispensers are usually silver with red inscriptions.

Knox-class frigates were United States Navy warships, originally laid down as ocean escorts (formerly called destroyer escorts), but were all redesignated as frigates on 30 June 1975 in the 1975 ship reclassification plan and their hull designation changed from DE to FF.
        
Modifications were made to Joseph Hewes and subsequent ships of the class. The primary differences were slightly different arrangement of the &quot;Officer's Country&quot; staterooms with additional staterooms in the 01 level instead of the open deck between the boat decks. The stateroom on the port side under the bridge was designated as a &quot;flag&quot; stateroom, with additional staterooms for flag staff when serving as a flagship. These ships have been referred to as the Joseph Hewes-sub-class.

The KS-12 is a heavy, single barrel AAA to be employed against high-altitude targets. The Chinese call it Type-72. It is pretty obsolete today, although some countries, including North Korea, still use it.
        
Adopted in 1939, the 85-mm M1939, like its counterpart the 88-mm gun, was meant for air defense. Like many anti-aircraft (AA) guns of the era it was provided with antitank ammunition in the event a tank should appear.

The Soviet build KS-19 is a replacement for the 85mm wartime cannons. Despite the age of the KS-19, it is still in use by some former Warsaw pact and other countries. This heavy AAA can be guided optically or by radar, the later off-carriage. The fire control radar employed is the SON-9 or SON-9A, NATO code name Fire Can.
                
Although being replaced by SAMs, the KS-19 can pose a threat to modern planes. This is simply due to it&apos;s enormous vertical range and the blast radius of it&apos;s shells. The KS-19 can also perform a ground role against tanks. The Chinese designation is Type 59.

The KSAM &quot;Pegasus&quot; is like it´s AAA cousin, the K-200AD, an indigenous South Korean product. Both weapons systems are mounted on the KIFV family of IPCs. The KSAM can therefore be thought to have engine performance similar to the K-200AD.
                
The Pegasus is a sophisticated, modern SHORAD system. It uses radar for surveillance and can track targets by radar or FLIR. The unmanned turret carries four launcher tubes, two of which on both sides.
                
In flight the missile is command-guided. Missile guidance and tracking is done vie the EOTS (Electro-Optical Tracking System). The target is tracked via radar or FLIR. The latter makes the Pegasus insusceptible against conventional countermeasures. The agile missile can however be beaten by creating line-of-sight problems due to the low tracking rate. The best way however is to stay out of the Pegasus´ engagement envelope altogether.

Unguided rockets are a cheap, unsophisticated means of scattering explosives around a target area. They are neither accurate nor particularly effective. Rockets are primarily a weapon for attacking infantry, but cluster bombs do the job better. White phosphorous (Willie Pete) rockets are often used by airborne Forward Air Controllers (FACs) to visually mark targets for attack aircraft.

The 5.0 Inch Rocket System uses the four round LAU-10C/A (shore-based use only) and LAU-10D/A (shore-based or shipboard use) rocket launchers. The LAU-10C/A and LAU-10D/A launchers can be fired in single or ripple mode. The difference between the LAU-10C/A and LAU-10D/A reusable rocket launchers is the external thermal coating on the LAU-10D/A that greatly prolongs cook-off protection time. Full production of these launchers began in September 1973.
                
The 5.0 Inch Rocket launchers are a cylindrical construction of four aluminum launch tubes. These launch tubes are held together with metal ribs and are covered by an aluminum skin. Launchers can be fitted with forward and aft frangible fairings depending on overall rocket length and fuzing for airborne configuration.
                
The launchers are mated mechanically to the aircraft by way of suspension lugs. The 5.0 Inch Rocket launchers use either a 14 inch or 30 inch suspension. Electrical connection between the aircraft and the launcher is made through an electrical receptacle located on top of the launcher center section to the aircraft?s 28 volt armament circuit. The launchers may be shipped and stored pre-loaded with rocket motors.

Since it can be efficiently transported by helicopter or cargo plane to combat zones, the LAV-25 is ideal for use by the U.S. Marines. It is a fast vehicle, and permits troops to rapidly advance either to reinforce units already in combat or to launch new offensives. Furthermore, it has several advantages over the Bradley IFV, since it is less expensive to buy and maintain, and the LAV-25&apos;s 8x8 wheeled design gives it a tremendous speed advantage over tracked vehicles.
                
LAV/AT
The LAV/AT variant is intended to provide heavy anti-tank fire support for ground troops. The LAV/AT&apos;s TOW II missile launcher has considerable range and damage potential, and the vehicle&apos;s high speed makes it a difficult target for enemy armor units.
                
LAV/M
The LAV/M is an indirect fire variant of the LAV-25. It mounts an 81mm mortar that replaces the 20mm gun. The mortar can be removed from the vehicle and fired from the ground. Its primary role is to provide supporting fire, smoke screens and illumination for infantry and other ground units.
                
LAV/C2
The LAV/C2 is the command variant of the LAV-25. The 20mm gun has been replaced by five radios of various types, which a battalion commander and his staff members use to coordinate activity in the field.
                
LAV/R
The LAV/R variant is designed to assist and support disabled vehicles in the field. In place of heavy weaponry, it comes with an impressive array of repair equipment. It has a 9,000-lb. crane, a winch with a 30,000-lb. maximum limit, a welder and a bank of floodlights for nighttime work.

The light armored vehicle (air defense variant) consists of what equates to an Avenger turret mounted on the chassis of a light armored vehicle (LAV)-25. Its primary mission is to provide low altitude air defense against forces from airborne threats by fixed and rotary winged aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles capable of speeds of zero to 500 NMPH, at ranges within the envelope of the Stinger Missiles and the 25mm ammunition. A secondary mission is to provide ground defense against light armored mechanized forces.
                
The Blazer turret includes a forward-looking infrared targeting sight, a laser rangefinder, and the option of employing either Stinger missiles or the rapid-fire GAU-12/U 25mm Gatling gun. The system maintains all the capabilities of the LAV-25 and Avenger with subtle differences. The turret is modified to fit the light armored vehicle and does not have the large crew space of Avenger. The crew compartment inside the light armored vehicle allows two operators with separate windows in the turret to search and scan the air from inside the vehicle.
                
The turret can slew 360° and has the same standard vehicle-mounted launcher configuration as Avenger. The .50 caliber machine gun was replaced by a 20 millimeter chain gun that provides antiair capabil-ity against aircraft within the inner launch boundary of a Stinger and a significant ground target engagement capability. Each standard vehicle-mounted launcher carries four Stinger missiles that can be fired in rapid succession. The LAV-AD can shoot on the move at speeds up to 30 miles per hour and can operate as an amphibious vehicle. The crew consists of a vehicle commander, two Stinger gunners, and a driver. The crew can communicate within the vehicle by intercom and externally via HF, VHF/FM, and UHF communications nets. The LAV-AD SINC-GARS radio suite is similar to the Avenger&apos;s radio suite and allows for the integration of the remote terminal unit and ground-based data link.
                
Although the LAV-AD is not an organic weapon system to the Marine aircraft wing, it is important to be aware of its associated organization, configuration, and operating characteristics. Stinger gunners and other Marines with Stinger backgrounds could be assigned to the light armored reconnaissance battalion to employ the LAV-AD. Although the tactics, techniques, and procedures associated with LAV-AD operations are still under development, it is likely the LAV-AD will be used in much the same manner as an Avenger-equipped LAAD unit in direct support of a maneuver element. The current concept of employment states that the primary mission of the LAV-AD is to provide local air defense for the light armored reconnaissance battalion, operating well forward of the fire support coordination line. It also outlines the planned table of organization that calls for an antiair warfare officer to command the LAV-AD company and Stinger staff noncommissioned officers and gunners to serve as crewmembers.

The LAV-AT anti-tank missile carrier is a mobile system is capable of defeating main battle tanks and fixed fortifications. It can be used both in defensive and offensive roles. It is one of the variants of the baseline LAV-25 armored vehicle. The LAV-AT was accepted to service with the US Marine Corps in the mid-1980s. Some sources report, that 95 of these vehicles were obtained.
                
The LAV-AT was originally fitted with the Emerson 901 (Hammerhead) weapon stations, which fires TOW wire-guided, optically tracked anti-tank missiles. The same turret was used on the M901 anti-tank missile carrier. A twin missile launcher is mounted on a roof, above the third wheel. It carries two ready-to-launch missiles and provides coverage in 360 degrees. Also there are 14 reload missiles, stowed inside the hull. Missiles are reloaded manually under armor protection. The LAV-AT fires its missiles only when stationary.
                
Vehicle also carries a ground mount for the TOW missiles with a hand-held laser rangefinder. This equipment allows to dismount and launch missiles remotely from the carrier.
                
Secondary armament consists of a pintle-mounted 7.62-mm machine gun with 1 000 rounds, which is used for self-defense.
                
Armor of the LAV-AT provides all-round protection against 7.62 rounds and artillery shell splinters. The front arc withstands 12.7-mm rounds. Vehicle also has NBC protection and automatic fire suppression systems.
                
The LAV-AT has a crew of four, including commander, gunner, loader and driver. Crew enter and leave the vehicle via doors or roof hatches. Vehicle has a night fighting capability and can be operated in all weather conditions.
                
This vehicle is powered by a Detroit Diesel 6V53T turbocharged diesel engine, developing 275 hp. Configuration can be switched from 8x4 (rear) to 8x8. Vehicle is fitted with a central tyre inflation system and run-flat tyres. Its mobility allows to keep pace with main battle tanks and reconnaissance forces.
                
The LAV-AT is amphibious with minimum of preparation. It is made fully-amphibious within three minutes. On water it is propelled by two waterjets, mounted at the rear of the hull. Vehicle is capable of fording streams, rivers and inland waterways.
                
The LAV-AT can be airlifted by a C-130 Hercules or larger transport aircraft. It can be also carried underslung by a CH-53E helicopter. These armored vehicles have been successfully para-dropped.
                
It is worth mentioning that currently the US Army uses a similar system, the M1134 Stryker. It has a different launcher and is mounted on the Striker ICV 8x8 chassis. This system entered service with the US Army in the mid-2000. The LAV-AT&apos;s are expected to remain in service with the US Marine Corps at least until 2024.

The Light Armoured Vehicle-Command and Control (LAV-C2) is a command post version of the LAV-25 with a higher roofline. It entered service with the US Marine Corps in the mid-1980s. Marines operate over 50 of these vehicles.
                
The LAV-C2 is an all-terrain, all-weather mobile command center with night capabilities. Vehicle is fitted with communication stations and gives a commander the capability to command, control and communicate (C3) the activities of his forces under full armor protection. This mobile command and communication vehicle provides field commanders with all necessary resources to control and coordinate light armored units in all assigned roles.
                
The only armament carried by this vehicle is a pintle-mounted 7.62-mm machine gun, which is used for self-defense. A total of 1 000 rounds are carried for this weapon. Also there are eight smoke grenade dischargers.
                
A welded armored hull of the LAV-C2 provides protection against 12.7-mm rounds at the front arc. All-round protection is against 7.62-mm rounds and artillery shell splinters. Vehicle has NBC protection and automatic fire suppression systems.
                
The LAV-C2 is powered by a Detroit Diesel 6V53T turbocharged diesel engine, developing 275 hp. Normally it has 8x4 configuration, which can be switched to 8x8 if necessary. Vehicle is amphibious after a short preparation. It is made fully amphibious within 3 minutes. On water it is propelled by two propellers, mounted at the hull rear.
                
The LAV-C2 can be airlifted via C-130 Hercules, C-141 StarLifter, C-5 Galaxy, or comparable military transport aircraft. It can be also carried underslung by a CH-53E Super Stallion helicopter.
                
Another variant of the LAV is the LAV-C2 Fire Direction Centre. The main mission for the FDC vehicle is to control and assign artillery fire missions. This vehicle chooses the type and number of rounds to fire. It provides firing data for up to eight mortars. It also maintains continuous digital or voice communications with all platoon elements within its area of responsibility, forward observers, fire support teams and higher headquarters. The FDC plans artillery fire and selects target priority. This vehicle also work out all the firing coordinates.
                
In 2004 the LAV-C2 vehicles were refitted with improved C2 capabilities, including new communication equipment and digital battlefield management systems. The last mentioned systems improve battlefield knowledge and situational awareness.

Leahy-class cruisers were a class of guided missile cruisers built for the United States Navy. They were originally designated as Destroyer Leaders (DLG), but in the 1975 cruiser realignment they were reclassified as guided missile cruisers (CG).
                
They were a new &quot;double-ender&quot; class fitted with Terrier (later Standard ER) missile launchers fore and aft, and the first and only frigate class designed without a main gun battery for shore bombardment or ship-vs.-ship engagements the gun armament was reduced in order to carry a larger missile load. One of the principal missions of these ships, like their predecessors the Farragut class, was to form part of the anti-air and antisubmarine screen for carrier task forces, while also controlling aircraft from the carrier by providing vectors to assigned targets.
                
The ships carried over the propulsion plant of the Farragut class, fitted into a longer hull designed with a knuckled hurricane bow that reduced plunging in a rough sea, thus keeping the forecastle dry as needed to operate the forward missile launcher. Other features included an expanded electrical plant and increased endurance. A major design innovation was the use of &quot;macks&quot; combined masts and stacks on which the radars could be mounted without smoke interference.
                
The first three ships were constructed at Bath Iron Works, the next two at New York Shipbulding Corp, and the rest at Puget Sound Bridge and Dry Dock Company, Todd Shipyards, San Pedro, CA, San Francisco Naval Shipyard and Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.
                
Modernizations were accomplished between 1967 and 1972, upgrading air warfare capabilities. Nearly all modernizations were completed at Bath Iron Works, but Leahy received the modernization at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard at a cost of $36.1 million.
                
All Leahy-class ships were modernized again in the late 1980s New Threat Upgrade program. This program added advanced air search and track radars (AN/SPS-49 and AN/SPS-48E), updated targeting radars (AN/SPG-55), and combat direction systems. The upgrade included massive remodeling of the ship from food service space rehabilitation to a main propulsion system overhaul.[3] Entire systems were removed and replaced, for example the AN/SPS-40 air-search radar was replaced with the AN/SPS-49 air-search radar. The upgrade was also quite expensive and the ships didn&apos;t serve much longer after the modification. For example, USS Gridley (CG-21) received NTU in 1991 at a cost of $55 million, but was decommissioned in early 1994.
                
The Leahy class (and near sisters of the Belknap class) were taken out of service in the early 1990s as part of the Clinton Administration&apos;s desire to reduce defense spending in light of reduced tensions with Russia. The entire class was decommissioned between 1993 and 1995, stricken from the naval register, and transferred to the Maritime Administration (MARAD) for disposal.

The Leopard (or Leopard 1) is a main battle tank designed and produced in West Germany that first entered service in 1965. Developed in an era when HEAT warheads were thought to make conventional heavy armour of limited value, the Leopard focused on firepower in the form of the German-built version of the British L7 105-mm gun, and improved cross-country performance that was unmatched by other designs of the era.
                
The design started as a collaborative project during the 1950s between West Germany and France and later joined by Italy, but the partnership ended shortly after and the final design was ordered by the Bundeswehr, with full-scale production starting in 1965. In total, 6,485 Leopard tanks have been built, of which 4,744 were battle tanks and 1,741 were utility and anti-aircraft variants, not including 80 prototypes and pre-series vehicles.
                
The Leopard quickly became a standard of European forces, and eventually served as the main battle tank in over a dozen countries worldwide. Since 1990, the Leopard 1 has gradually been relegated to secondary roles in most armies. In the German Army, the Leopard 1 MBTs were phased out in 2003, while Leopard 1 derived vehicles are still widely used. The Leopard 2 MBTs have taken over the MBT role. Leopard hulls have been re-used in a wide variety of roles.

The Leopard 2 is a main battle tank developed by Krauss-Maffei in the 1970s for the West German Army. The tank first entered service in 1979 and succeeded the earlier Leopard 1 as the main battle tank of the German Army. It is armed with a 120 mm smoothbore cannon, and is powered by a V-12 twin-turbo diesel engine. Various versions have served in the armed forces of Germany and 12 other European countries, as well as several non-European nations, including Canada, Chile, Indonesia, Singapore, and Turkey. The Leopard 2 was used in Kosovo with the German Army, and has seen action in Afghanistan with the Dutch, Danish and Canadian contributions to the International Security Assistance Force, as well as also seeing action in Syria with the Turkish Armed Forces against ISIS and the YPG.
                
There are two main development batches of the tank: the original models up to Leopard 2A4, which have vertically faced turret armour, and the improved batch, namely the Leopard 2A5 and newer versions, which have angled arrow-shaped turret appliqu armour together with other improvements. All models feature digital fire control systems with laser rangefinders, a fully stabilised main gun and coaxial machine gun, and advanced night vision and sighting equipment (first vehicles used a low-light level TV system or LLLTV; thermal imaging was introduced later on). The tank has the ability to engage moving targets while moving over rough terrain.
                
Even as the Leopard 1 was just entering service, the German military was interested in producing an improved tank in the next decade. This resulted in the start of the MBT-70 development in cooperation with the United States beginning in 1963. However already in 1967 it became questionable whether the MBT-70 would enter service at any time in the foreseeable future. Therefore, the German government issued the order to research future upgrade options of the Leopard 1 to the German company Porsche in 1967. This study was named vergoldeter Leopard (Gilded Leopard) and focused on incorporating advanced technology into the Leopard design. The projected upgrades added an autoloader, a coaxial autocannon and an independent commander&apos;s periscope. The anti-air machine gun could be operated from inside the vehicle and a TV surveillance camera was mounted on an expendable mast. The shape of the turret and hull was optimised using cast steel armour, while the suspension, transmission and the engine exhaust vents were improved

Liaoning  is a Chinese Type 001 aircraft carrier. The first aircraft carrier commissioned into the People's Liberation Army Navy Surface Force, she was originally classified as a training ship, intended to allow the Navy to experiment, train and gain familiarity with aircraft carrier operations. Following upgrades and additional training in late 2018, state media announced that the ship would shift to a combat role in 2019.
         
Originally laid down in 1985 for the Soviet Navy as the Kuznetsov-class aircraft cruiser Riga, she was launched on 4 December 1988 and renamed Varyag in 1990. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, construction was halted and the ship was put up for sale by Ukraine. The stripped hulk was purchased in 1998 and towed to the Dalian naval shipyard in northeast China.
          
The ship was rebuilt and commissioned into the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) as Liaoning on 25 September 2012. Its Chinese ship class designation is Type 001. In November 2016, the political commissar of Liaoning, Commodore Li Dongyou, stated that Liaoning was combat ready.
         
The Kuznetsov-class ships were originally designated by the Soviet Navy as tyazholiy avianesushchiy kreyser, TAKR or TAVKR, meaning &quot;heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser&quot;. In addition to aircraft, the ships were designed to carry P-700 Granit anti-ship cruise missiles that also form the main armament of the Kirov-class battlecruisers. This multirole capability allowed the ships to avoid classification as aircraft carriers, thus allowing them to pass through the Turkish Straits between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. Under the Montreux Convention, aircraft carriers larger than 15,000 tons are not permitted to pass through the Straits, but there is no displacement limit on other types of capital ship from Black Sea powers.
      
In contrast, the People's Liberation Army Navy considers Liaoning to be an aircraft carrier. Since China is not located on the Black Sea and thus not considered a Black Sea power under the Montreux Convention, it does not need and cannot use the tonnage exemption for non-aircraft carrier capital ships. The ship was completed as an aircraft carrier, and cruise missiles were never installed. Liaoning is equipped only with air defence weapons and must use its aircraft for surface attack.

The Long Track is a highly mobile aerial surveillance radar mounted on a tracked vehicle. The system is normally used for target acquisition by forward-area Air Defense Artillery (ADA) systems, including the SA-4, the SA-6, SA-8 and the SA-11. Normally the Long Track radar vehicle will remain with the headquarters of an ADA battalion. The headquarters staff will pass targeting information from the Long Track to the battalion&apos;s missile batteries. While most SAM fire control radar have limited search capabilities, the Long Track can greatly increase the coordination and effectiveness of an air defense system. The Thin Skin height-finder radar is also an associated system.

The Low Blow is the missile control radar for the SA-3 SAM system. The radar is optimized for detecting targets at low and medium altitudes. Independent analysis has found this radar to be surprisingly effective at picking targets out of ground clutter. The system can simultaneously track up to six aircraft but can only guide missiles to one target at a time. The Low Blow radar is also coupled with a TV camera that allows the radar technician to manually track targets when automatic radar tracking is disabled by electronic countermeasures (ECM). The Low Blow is normally used in conjunction with a Flat Face search and acquisition radar, but other search systems such as the Long Track or the Bar Lock can also be used.

The M1A1 Abrams is the first tank in the world to be equipped with a turbine as its engine. The incredible power generated by the turbine allows the Abrams to travel at high speeds for a tank. This tank also boasts depleted uranium armor, which has been proven in battle to withstand direct hits from a T-72&apos;s main gun. This near invulnerability, combined with its own devastating 120mm gun guided by laser rangefinders, auto lead and temperature adjustment, and wind speed sensors, gives the Abrams both near-impunity and incredible accuracy on the battlefield. While the Abrams is a devastating war machine, there is considerable debate as to the value of the turbine engine. While it does provide a great deal of power, it also generates an enormous amount of heat, which makes it easy to spot via infrared, and it consumes large amounts of fuel.
                
Three main versions of the M1 Abrams have been deployed, the M1, M1A1, and M1A2, incorporating improved armament, protection, and electronics. These improvements and other upgrades to in-service tanks have allowed this long-serving vehicle to remain in front-line service. In addition, development of the improved M1A3 version was first publicly disclosed in 2009.
                
The M1 Abrams was developed during the Cold War as a successor to the canceled MBT-70. The M1 Abrams contract went to Chrysler Defense and was the first vehicle to adopt Chobham armor. Adaptations before the Persian Gulf War (Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm) gave the vehicle better firepower and NBC (Nuclear, Biological and Chemical) protection. Being vastly superior to Iraqi tanks, very few M1 tanks were hit by enemy fire. Upgrades after the war improved the tank&apos;s weapons sights and fire control unit. The Abrams participated in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, exposing vulnerabilities in urban combat that were addressed with the Tank Urban Survival Kit (TUSK) modifications (armor upgrades and a gun shield). The Marine Corps sent a company of M1A1 Abrams tanks to Afghanistan in 2010.
                
The U.S. Army planned to end production at the Lima Army Tank Plant from 2013 to 2016 in an effort to save over $1 billion; it would be restarted in 2017 to upgrade existing tanks. General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS), which operates the factory, opposed the move, arguing that suspension of operations would increase long-term costs and reduce flexibility. Specifically, GDLS estimated that closing the plant would cost $380 million and restarting production would cost $1.3 billion.
                
By August 2013, Congress had allocated $181 million for buying parts and upgrading Abrams systems to mitigate industrial base risks and sustain development and production capability. Congress and General Dynamics were criticized for redirecting money to keep production lines open and accused of &quot;forcing the Army to buy tanks it didn&apos;t need.&quot; General Dynamics asserted that a four-year shutdown would cost $1.1 - 1.6 billion to reopen the line, depending on the length of the shutdown, whether machinery would be kept operating, and whether the plant&apos;s components would be completely removed. They contended that the move was to upgrade Army National Guard units to expand a &quot;pure fleet&quot; and maintain production of identified &quot;irreplaceable&quot; subcomponents; a prolonged shutdown could cause their makers to lose their ability to produce them and foreign tank sales were not guaranteed to keep production lines open. There is still risk of production gaps even with production extended through 2015; with funds awarded before recapitalization is needed, budgetary pressures may push planned new upgrades for the Abrams from 2017 to 2019. In December 2014, Congress again allocated $120 million, against the wishes of the Army, for Abrams upgrades including improving gas mileage by integrating an auxiliary power unit to decrease idle time fuel consumption and upgrading the tank&apos;s sights and sensors.

While the M1A2 is similar to the A1, there are some significant improvements in this version. The M-1A2 comes with an array of vastly upgraded targeting, fire control and electronic equipment. This version also includes Commander&apos;s Independent Thermal Vision (CITV) equipment, which provides the commander 360-degree vision day or night in any weather-all from within the tank. The commander is thus able to identify the tank&apos;s next target while the gunner is engaging the current target.
                
This is the latest Abrams tank which is an upgrade of the M1A1 version. The U.S. Army has ordered 1,150 M1A2SEP (S/stems Enhancement Package) to be in service by 2004. The SEP contains a new version of command and control systems, new commander&apos;s independent Thermal Viewer and display for digital terrain color maps, second generation thermal imaging sight with improved range. The 120mm smoothbore gun from Rheinmetall GmbH can fire a variety of ammunition including the M829APFSDS-T with a depleted uranium penetrator. The tank is protected with steel encased depleted uranium armor. Main ammo storage is stored behind armored sliding doors. The top panels are designed to blow outward in the event of penetration by a HEAT projectile. A new engine is under consideration for the M1A2. Heavy fuel consumption remains a problem with the turbo engine.
                
The M1A2 was a further improvement of the M1A1 with a commander&apos;s independent thermal viewer, weapon station, position navigation equipment, and a full set of controls and displays linked by a digital data bus. These upgrades also provided the M1A2 with an improved fire control system. The M1A2 System Enhancement Package (SEP) added digital maps, Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) Linux communications system capabilities for commanders, and an improved cooling system to compensate for heat generated by the additional computer systems. The M1A2 SEP also serves as the basis for the M104 Wolverine heavy assault bridge. The M1A2 SEPv2 (version 2) added Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS or CROWS II) support, color displays, better interfaces, a new operating system, better front and side armor, and an upgraded transmission for better durability. Further upgrades included depleted uranium armor for all variants, a system overhaul that returns all A1s to like-new condition (M1A1 AIM), a digital enhancement package for the A1 (M1A1D), and a commonality program to standardize parts between the U.S. Army and the Marine Corps (M1A1HC). The development for the improved M1A3 variant has been known since 2009
                
The M1A2 SEP TUSK Abrams and a modernized M1 Abrams were included in the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) Analysis of Alternatives (AOA). Vehicles included in the AOA were determined to be inferior to the planned GCV. The U.S. Army Vice Chief of Staff Gen. Peter Chiarelli commended the M1 Abrams program and recommended a similar approach for the GCV program. The Ground Combat Vehicle family of vehicles was the planned successor to the M1 as well as many other U.S. Army vehicles. However, the Army anticipates that the remaining M1A1 fleet will remain in U.S. service until at least 2021, and the M1A2 to beyond 2050.
                
The M1A3 Abrams was in the early design period with the U.S. Army in 2009. At that time, the service was seeking a lighter tank version with the same protection as current versions. It aimed to build prototypes by 2014 and begin fielding the first combat-ready M1A3s by 2017. In March 2017, it was reported that the new version, the M1A2 SEP v4, is to begin testing in 2021.

M2A3
The M2A3 variant is more heavily armed than the other variants, with over twice as many missiles and extra ammo for the 25mm chain gun. This extra ordnance is included at the cost of four personnel and the removal of the infantry firing ports.
                
M2A2 BCV
Nearly identical to the basic Bradley, the BCV is the command variant of this vehicle. In place of a load of troops, it carries an extensive array of communications and electronic equipment and the required operating personnel.
                
M2A3 / M3A3
The A3 upgrade to the Army&apos;s Bradley fighting vehicle system is a major component of the Army digitization initiative, designed both to complement the capabilities provided by the M1A2 SEP and to incorporate needed enhancements identified during the Gulf War. The M2A3/M3A3 will be equipped with a digital electronic architecture incorporating on-board subsystem monitoring, diagnostics/ prognostics, and an Army Technical Architecture (ATA) compliant Command and Control software suite that is fully interoperable with M1A2 SEP and M1A1 D tanks, and other Force XXI digitized platforms. When equipped with upgraded Bradleys, mechanized infantry units will be able to share battlefield data with M1A2 SEP-equipped armor units. The digitization upgrades will improve both situational awareness and sustainability through automated fault reporting and diagnostics. The A3 upgrade will also increase the lethality of the Bradley by adding an improved fire control system and a commander&apos;s independent thermal viewer. BFVS-A3 enhancements include
                
- A vehicle control and operation system to control and automate many crew functions and to enhance situational awareness by transmitting, receiving, storing, and displaying digital messages. This digital capability is to be compatible with all components of the combined arms team.
                
- The improved Bradley acquisition system (IBAS) and commander&apos;s independent viewer, both 2nd generation FLIR&apos;s, to improve target acquisition and target engagement.

The Bradley Stinger fighting vehicle is a variant of the basic Bradley, and differs only in its weaponry and troop load. The number of TOW missiles it carries has been reduced, and it seats one fewer soldier. In exchange, the vehicle now accommodates a quad Stinger launcher. In addition, these vehicles often carry a team of five troops armed with man-portable versions of the Stinger, making this vehicle that much more deadly against air threats.

The M6 Linebacker short-range air defense system was developed by Boeing to meet the US Army requirements. The new vehicle was intended to counter the threat posed by low-flying aircraft, helicopters, cruise missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles to forward armored formations. Initial production Linebackers entered service with the US Army in 1997. A total of 99 Bradley Linebackers were ordered, however in 2006 these were phased-out of service.
                
The M6 is an all-weather system, capable of operating in day/night and all weather conditions. It is based on the M2 Bradley IFV and is equipped with a quadruple launcher with FIM-92 Stinger short-range surface-to-air missiles instead of the TOW ATGW. It is worth mentioning that Linebacker uses components of the Avenger air defense system.
                
The Stinger is a two-stage solid fuel self-homing missile with infra-red guidance. It is a fire-and-forget type weapon. Four missiles are carried in the launcher, while additional 8 reload missiles are stored inside the hull. The M6 can launch its missiles while stationary or on the move.
                
Additionally the Linebacker retains the M242 Bushmaster turret-mounted 25-mm chain gun and coaxial 7.62-mm machine gun. These weapons are mainly used against ground targets, however can be also used against low-flying air targets.
                
The Linebacker has a modified fire control system. It has an integrated positioning and navigation capability. This combat vehicle has an optical tracker and thermal imaging system. Targeting data is provided by forward area air defense radar.
                
The Linebacker has a crew of four, which conducts surface-to-air engagement under armor. In case of emergency crew can dismount and launch Stinger missiles remotely from the vehicle.
                
The Bradley Linebacker has a welded aluminum armor hull with add-on steel armor. It protects the crew from 14.5-mm armor-piercing rounds. Explosive reactive armor kit can be also added if required.
                
The M6 air defense system is powered by Cummins VTA-903T turbocharged diesel engine, developing 600 hp. It is worth mentioning that the Linebackers were mainly based on improved M2A2 chassis. The this air defense vehicle is fully amphibious with the use of swim barrier. On water it is propelled by spinning its tracks. Swimming capabilities can be improved by the erection of inflatable buoyancy tanks. The Linebacker maintains pace with the armored force.

These bombs are all general purpose high explosive bombs.
                
To overcome the erratic flight of these bombs when dropped from high altitudes by very heavy bombers, the tail assembly of the 260 pound Fragmentation Bomb M81 replaces the customary tail unit, which is two inches shorter, for such missions. Use of the Cluster Adapter M22 permits single suspension for four GP Bombs AN-M30 or AN-M30A1.
                
The AN-M30A1 bomb contains antiwithdrawal pins in the base plug and a device for locking the adapter booster to the base plug. The earlier model, AN-M30, does not have these features.
                
The AN-M30 bomb is lighter in weight than its modification, the AN-M30A1. The AN-M30 may be loaded with 105.5 pounds of Tritonal, 102.5 pounds of TNT, or 99.0 pounds of Amatol 50-50.
                
The bombs are painted an overall olive drab with one inch-yellow bands around the nose and base and a 1/4 inch yellow band around the center of gravity.

The M47 Dragon, known as the FGM-77 during development, is an American shoulder-fired, man-portable anti-tank missile system. It was phased out of U.S. military service in 2001, in favor of the newer FGM-148 Javelin system.
                
The M47 Dragon uses a wire-guidance system in concert with a high explosive anti-tank warhead and was capable of defeating armored vehicles, fortified bunkers, main battle tanks, and other hardened targets. While it was primarily created to defeat the Soviet Union&apos;s T-55, T-62, and T-72 tanks, it saw use well into the 1990s, seeing action in the Persian Gulf War. The U.S. military officially retired the weapon in 2001, although stocks of the weapon remain in reserve in U.S. arsenals and are in active service with other militaries around the world.
                
The principles of flight and guidance were interesting. The first oddity was the delay between snapping the trigger and the ignition of the launch motor. This was due to a chemical battery charging the initiator circuit (the operator could hear a rising whine similar to the whine made by early integrated flash cameras when charging the flash circuit). This usually led to the operator tensing up in anticipation of the sudden explosion from the launcher that he knew was coming. The missile was discharged from the launcher tube by a &quot;launch motor&quot;, which was a rocket motor that completely expended itself within the tube so as not to injure the operator with exhaust gas. The missile coasted away from the operator and a burning infrared flare was ignited at the rear of the missile.
                
After the missile was about 30 to 50 metres (100 to 160 ft) from the gunner, the missile was propelled forward and guided towards the target by three rows of thrusters aligned longitudinally along the missile body. The rocket spiralled as it moved forward, and the thrusters were fired in pairs to move the missile forward as well as keep the missile on target. These were activated by the sight controller which sent signals from the sight mechanism to the missile along the wire which spooled out behind the missile and remained connected to the sight. The operator kept the sight crosshairs on the target; the sight tracked the infrared flare and sent corrections to the missile service motor to bring the flight of the missile to the aim point. The service charges were fired as needed both to keep the missile correcting toward the aim point and to keep it up and moving forward. A missile moving towards a stationary target and tracked by a steady gunner would fire the thrusters about every .5 to 1 second, resulting in its signature &apos;popping&apos; sound as it moved downrange. If the operator over-corrected his aim point beyond the service motor&apos;s capability to keep up, the missile grounded itself. Conversely, if the guidance wire broke, the missile would fire its rockets rapidly, sending the missile into a rapid ascent. This was a recoilless weaponthe launcher did not &quot;kick&quot; per se when fired but the sudden loss of the 30 pounds (14 kg) missile weight from the shoulder caused many soldiers to flinch badly enough to lose track of the target, resulting in a missile grounding
                
The Dragon is a man-portable anti-tank weapon. Despite its ability to penetrate nearly two feet of steel armor, it has some definite limitations. It not only has a short range, but also a targeting system that is dangerous to its crew. To hit a target, the gunner must remain in his position-with his sights constantly focused on the target-until the missile hits. Unfortunately, this exposes the gunner for up to 16 seconds. It is estimated that more than one-third of all Dragon crews will experience casualties in combat situations.

First produced less than 10 years after World War II, the M-48 was a considerable improvement over America&apos;s previous main battle tank, the M-47. Since then the tank was repeatedly upgraded until replaced in U.S. inventory by the M-60. The M-48 A5 is a rugged, dependable tank, but it has a number of drawbacks. For example, it has a limited amount of engine power, it only carries a modest amount of ammunition and it has an unpleasant tendency to burst into flames when hit by enemy fire. However, it is still in use by a number of nations primarily because its cost is low.
                
The M48 Patton tank was designed to replace the previous M47 Pattons and M4 Shermans. Although bearing some semblance to the M47, the M48 was a completely new design, featuring a complete new turret as well as modified hull. It was the last U.S. tank to mount the 90 mm tank gun, with the last model, the M48A5, being upgraded to carry the new standard weapon of the M60, the 105mm gun. Some M48A5 models served well into the 1980s with U.S. Army National Guard units, and many M48s remain in service in other countries. The Turkish Army has the largest number of modernized M48 MBTs, with more than 1,400 in its inventory. Of these, around 1,000 have been phased out, placed in storage, or modified as ARVs.
                
In the mid-1970s, the vehicle was modified to carry the heavier 105 mm gun. The original program designation was XM736. The designation was subsequently changed to M48A3E1 and was finally standardized as M48A5. As many components from the M60A1 were utilized as possible. Anniston Army Depot was issued a contract to convert 501 M48A3 tanks to the M48A5 standard and this was completed in December 1976. These early M48A5&apos;s were essentially M48A3 tanks with the 105mm gun added. They retained the M1 cupola armed with a .50 cal machine gun.
                
Based on Israeli experience in upgrading M48 series tanks, further changes were included starting in August 1976. These included replacing the M1 cupola with a low-profile &quot;Urdan&quot; type cupola that mounted an M60D machine gun for use by the tank commander. A second M60D machine gun was mounted on the turret roof for use by the loader. Internal ammunition stowage for the 105mm main gun was also increased to 54 rounds. These tanks were initially given the designation M48A5API; but, after early conversions were brought up to the later standard, the API was removed and these tanks were known simply as M48A5.
                
In addition to the conversion of M48A3 tanks, an additional conversion process for bringing M48A1 tanks to M48A5 standard was also developed. By March 1978, 708 M48A5 tanks had been converted from the M48A1 model.
                
Work continued until December 1979, at which time 2069 M48A5&apos;s had been converted.
                
The vast majority of M48A5 tanks in service with US Army units were assigned to National Guard and Army Reserve Units. A notable exception was the 2nd Infantry Division in the Republic of Korea, who replaced their M60A1 tanks with M48A5&apos;s, which arrived in June and July 1978. On 2nd Infantry Division M48A5 tanks the commander&apos;s M60D was replaced with a .50 caliber M2 machine gun.
                
By the mid-1990s, the M48s were phased out of U.S. service. Many other countries, however, continued to use these M48 models.

The M60 Patton is an American second generation main battle tank (MBT) introduced in December 1960.[11] With the United States Army&apos;s deactivation of their last (M103) heavy tank battalion in 1963, the M60 became the Army&apos;s primary tank[12] during the Cold War. Although developed from the M48 Patton, the M60 series was never officially classified as a Patton tank, but as a &quot;product-improved descendant&quot; of the Patton series. In March 1959, the tank was officially standardized as the 105 mm Gun Full Tracked Combat Tank M60. Over 15,000 M60s were built by Chrysler. Hull production ended in 1983, but 5,400 older models were converted to the M60A3 variant ending in 1990.
                
The M60 underwent many updates over its service life. The interior layout, based on the design of the M48, provided ample room for updates and improvements, extending the vehicle&apos;s service life for over four decades. It was widely used by the U.S. and its Cold War allies, especially those in NATO, and remains in service throughout the world today, despite having been superseded by the M1 Abrams in the U.S. military. Egypt is currently the largest operator with 1,716 upgraded M60A3s, Turkey is second with 866 upgraded units in service, and Saudi Arabia is third with over 650 units.
                
The M60 is the replacement for the M48. Introduced into service in 1961, it was criticized for it&apos;s limited cross-country abilities and high profile. However, it prooved reliable and underwent many upgrades.
                
M60A3
Ending in 1990, 5400 older M60s were upgraded with an AN/VSG-2 Tank Thermal Sight (TTS), a M21 hybrid solid-state ballistic computer, AN/VVG-2 laser range finder and a turret stabilisation system.
                
M60AVLB
This variant carries a 60ft scissor type bridge along.
                
M60AVLM/MS
This is a mine clearing variant of the M-60AVLB.

The M72 LAW (Light Anti-Tank Weapon, also referred to as the Light Anti-Armor Weapon or LAW as well as LAWS: Light Anti-Armor Weapons System) is a portable one-shot 66-mm unguided anti-tank weapon. The solid rocket propulsion unit was developed in the newly formed Rohm and Haas research laboratory at Redstone Arsenal in 1959, then the full system was designed by Paul V. Choate, Charles B. Weeks, Frank A. Spinale, et al. at the Hesse-Eastern Division of Norris Thermadore. American production of the weapon began by Hesse-Eastern in 1963, and was terminated by 1983; currently it is produced by Nammo Raufoss AS in Norway and their subsidiary Nammo Talley, Inc. in Arizona.
        
In early 1963, the M72 LAW was adopted by the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps as their primary individual infantry anti-tank weapon, replacing the M31 HEAT rifle grenade and the M20A1 &quot;Super Bazooka&quot; in the U.S. Army. It was subsequently adopted by the U.S. Air Force to serve in an anti-emplacement/anti-armor role in Air Base Defense duties.
      
In the early 1980s, the M72 was slated to be replaced by the FGR-17 Viper. However, this program was canceled by Congress and the M136 AT4 was adopted instead. At that time, its nearest equivalents were the Swedish Pskott m/68 (Miniman) and the French SARPAC

The M88A2 IRV is essentially a tank tow truck although it can easily recover lighter vehicles as well. While this vehicle isn&apos;t heavily armed or armored, it doesn&apos;t have to be. Its role generally doesn&apos;t come into play until after the battle is over, or the lines have advanced. It is equipped with a dozer blade and an A-frame style crane. It has a winch that is capable of moving massive amounts with an absolute maximum pull of nearly 180,000 lbs. and a maximum hoisting capacity of around 100,000 lbs. This vehicle is even capable of towing an M1A1 Abrams by itself.

The M106 carrier is the M113 armored personnel carrier modified to carry the M30 4.2-inch (107mm) mortar on a specially designed turntable mount. It is an armored, full-tracked, self-propelled vehicle that can swim streams and small bodies of water. A .50 caliber machine gun is mounted on the cupola for the vehicle commander&apos;s use.
                
To fire the 4.2-inch mortar from the carrier, the top plating to the rear of the carrier has a mortar-hatch cover, which is hinged and folds to both sides. The carrier provides limited armor protection for the squad during maneuver. In combat, the mortar is fired with the ramp closed and locked. During firing exercises in training, the mortar may be fired with the ramp open for visual inspection by safety personnel.
                
The mortar and its components can be removed from the carrier for ground-mounted firing. The baseplate, bridge, and rotator assemblies of the ground mount are stowed outside the carrier. A minimum of four mortarmen is required to remove the mortar and standard assembly from the travel position.
                
Replaced by the M1064A3 120mm mortar carrier in U.S. service.

The M109 is the most commonly used vehicle of its type in the world. 
                      
This self-propelled artillery piece is constantly being upgraded to increase its usefulness and has a wide range of ammunition available. It is capable of firing nuclear, chemical, smoke, rocket-assisted HE rounds and more standard HE ammunition. The M109&apos;s maximum effective firing range is 15,966 yards (about nine miles) with standard HE rounds.
                     
n January 2016, the U.S. Army test-fired hypervelocity projectiles originally designed for use by U.S. Navy electromagnetic railguns and found that they significantly increased the gun's range. The Army is looking into using the M109 Paladin firing the HVP for ballistic missile defense, as traditional missile interceptors are expensive and gun-based missile defense used for point defense would use artillery at a much lower cost per round. The HVP is capable of being fired out to 50 nautical miles (58 mi; 93 km) from a conventional cannon. It weighs 68 lb (31 kg) with a 46 lb (21 kg) flight body containing its guidance and warheadless powerful, but more agile to hit small, high-speed targets. Modifications will be needed for the Paladin to effectively shoot the HVP, possibly including different propellant to achieve higher velocities, automated reloading systems to fire quickly enough to defeat salvo launches, improved barrel life, and a new fire control and sensor system.

The M-113 APC is the most widely used armored vehicle in the world. In service since 1960, more than 73,000 have been built, in hundreds of variants. This tracked vehicle has limited amphibious capability and functions well in many environments. Furthermore, this armored personnel carrier (APC) is extremely versatile, cheap, and capable of transporting 11 troops with some degree of protection. The M-113 is currently being replaced in U.S. service by the M2 Bradley because the M-113 has proven extremely vulnerable to mines, and because the soldier operating the vehicle-mounted weapon does not have any protection.
                
M-113/A3
The M-113/A3 is similar to the standard M113. The transmission has been upgraded, and the vehicle can be outfitted with additional external armor or external fuel tanks.

The M117 is an air-dropped general-purpose bomb used by United States military forces. It dates back to the time of the Korean War of the early 1950s. Although it has a nominal weight of 750 lb (343 kg), its actual weight, depending on fuse and retardation options, is around 820 lb (373 kg). Its explosive content is typically 403 lb (183 kg) of Minol 2 or Tritonal.
                
In the 1950s through the early 1970s the M117 was a standard aircraft weapon, carried by the F-100 Super Sabre, F-104 Starfighter, F-105 Thunderchief, F-111, and F-4 Phantom, but at present it is used only by USAF heavy bomber aircraft like the B-52 Stratofortress, tactical aircraft now tending to use the Mark 80-series bombs (particularly the Mk 82 or Mk 83 and their guided equivalents). The B-52 reportedly dropped 44,600 M117s during the 1991 Gulf War.
                
It can be fitted with two tail units; the MAU-103 low drag tail and the MAU-91 high drag tail.
                
The M117 was the basis of the MC-1 chemical warfare bomb, which used a canister of Sarin nerve gas. The MC-1 has never been used by the U.S. in combat and was eliminated from the U.S. stockpile in June, 2006
                
These are general-purpose (GP) high explosive (HE) bombs which may use proximity, mechanical, or electric nose and tail fuzes. When used as an M117D (destructor), the M117 bomb has a fuzing system actuated by magnetic/seismic influence. Both fragmentation and blast effect are produced by these bombs.

The M118 is an air-dropped general-purpose or demolition bomb used by United States military forces. It dates back to the time of the Korean War of the early 1950s. Although it has a nominal weight of 3,000 lb (1,361 kg), its actual weight, depending on fuse and retardation options, is somewhat higher. A typical non-retarded configuration has a total weight of 3,049 lb (1,383 kg) with an explosive content of 1,975 lb (895 kg) of Tritonal.
                
In the late 1950s through the early 1970s it was a standard aircraft weapon, carried by the F-100 Super Sabre, F-104 Starfighter, F-105 Thunderchief, and F-4 Phantom. Some apparently remain in the USAF inventory, although they are rarely used today.

The MLRS is a multiple-rocket launcher that is loaded on a lightly armored vehicle similar to an M2 Bradley chassis. With its extremely long range, it can deliver hundreds of mines to remote areas or drop massive amounts of small munitions on top of enemy units with impunity. It is capable of launching all 12 of its rockets simultaneously and is equipped with a twin boom crane to allow reloading without the assistance of heavy equipment.
                       
In 2006, MLRS was upgraded to fire guided rounds. Phase I testing of a guided unitary round (XM31) was completed on an accelerated schedule in March 2006. Due to an Urgent Need Statement, the guided unitary round was quickly fielded and used in action in Iraq

The Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) is an eight-wheel drive, diesel-powered, 10-short-ton (9,100 kg), tactical truck used by the US military and others. In evolving configurations, it has been in continuous production since 1982. The M977 HEMTT entered service with the U.S. Army as a replacement for the M520 Goer.
                
By early 2015, more than 27,000 HEMTTs in various configurations had been produced by Oshkosh Defense through either new-build or re-manufactured. Current variants have the A4 suffix.
                
The 10×10 Oshkosh Logistic Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR) is the U.S. Marines&apos; equivalent to the U.S. Army&apos;s Oshkosh 8×8 HEMTT and Oshkosh 10×10 Palletized Load System (PLS). The Marines do not use the HEMTT or PLS, and the Army does not use the LVSR, but both services use a common trailer (M1076) with all three truck types.
                
The HEMTT, pronounced &quot;Hemet,&quot; is one of the main heavy trucks in use by the U.S. military. It can carry a 10-ton load, contains a light duty crane, can travel over virtually any terrain under any conditions and can keep up with the fastest advances. Battle proven in the Gulf War, users highly praised the HEMTT as the only supply vehicle able to keep up during the rapid armored advance.
                
The M977A0/A2/A4 Electrical Power Plant (EPP) has an extended cargo body (6.041 m (19.82 ft) inside length) and is used to hold and transport generators for the Patriot air-defence missile system. There is no material handling crane on the EPP.

The M-978 variant of the HEMTT is a tanker version of the truck. Instead of a cargo payload, the truck transports 2,500 U.S. gallons of fuel.
                
The M978A0 was produced in both potable water (approximately 18) and fuel servicing truck variants, the A2 and A4 models have only been produced in the fuel servicing truck variant.
                
The HEMTT&apos;s objective is to provide heavy transport capabilities for supply and re-supply of combat vehicles and weapons systems. Compared to earlier generation 5-ton trucks in U.S. Army service it offers increased payload and mobility. The HEMTT is available in a variety of configurations, including cargo, tanker, tractor and wrecker.
                
The HEMTT was developed from the outset as a tactical truck, but to minimize procurement and life cycle costs included militarized commercial automotive components where possible, these including the engine and transmission. Some components used in early HEMTTs are common with the Oshkosh Logistics Vehicle System (LVS) vehicles which were supplied to the U.S. Marine Corps.
                
With the exception of the M984 wrecker variant (254 × 89 × 9.5 mm, front; 356 × 89 × 9.5 mm, rear), on all HEMTT variants the chassis is formed of 257 × 89 × 9.5 mm heat-treated carbon manganese steel with a yield strength of 758 MPa. Bolted construction with Grade 8 bolts is used throughout. A centrally mounted self-recovery winch is an option and this is fitted to around 20% of production.
                
The HEMTT&apos;s two-door forward control cab seats two. It is of heavy-duty welded steel construction with corrosion-resistant sheet metal skins. Simula Inc. (acquired by Armor Holdings in 2003 and now BAE Systems) supplied 186 add-on cab armoring kits for use in the former Yugoslavia. These were not issued, but from 2004 were used in Iraq. BAE systems supplied a next-generation armor kit for the HEMTT and by late-2006 had supplied the U.S. Army with around 3600 kits for the Oshkosh HEMTT and PLS. The HEMTT A4 is fitted with the slightly larger from the Oshkosh PLS A1. This cab complies with the U.S. Army&apos;s Long Term Armor Strategy (LTAS) requirements of an A- and B-kit armoring philosophy. It also comes as standard with integrated floor armor, an integrated mount for a machine gun and gunner protection kit, and air-conditioning.
                
A Detroit Diesel 8V92TA V-8 two-stroke diesel developing 445 hp (332 kW) is fitted in HEMTT A0 and A1 models, with the DDECIV version of this engine fitted to A2 HEMTTs. An EPA 2004 compliant Caterpillar (CAT) C-15 six-cylinder, 15.2-liter diesel developing a peak of 515 hp (384 kW) is fitted to HEMTT A4 models. HEMTT A0 and A1 models are fitted with an Allison HT 740D 4F/1R automatic transmission, torque converter, and Oshkosh 55,000-pound (25,000 kg) two-speed transfer case. HEMTT A2 models have the Allison HD 4560P 6F/1R automatic transmission. HEMTT A4 models are fitted with an Allison 4500SP 5F/1R automatic transmission and an uprated version of Oshkosh&apos;s 55,000-pound (25,000 kg) two-speed transfer case.
                
The front axles on all HEMTTs are single-reduction Oshkosh 46K, the rear are Dana single-reduction which vary according to configuration. Drive to the front axles is selectable and all axles have differential locks. Suspension on A0/A1/A3 models is by Hendrickson leaf springs with equalizing beams. Suspension on A4 models is Holland air suspension, load rating on the rear axles varying by configuration. Tire size is 1600 R20 on all models, and standard tire fit is Michelin XZL.
                
All models are capable of fording water crossings up to 48 in (120 cm) deep, and can climb a gradient of at least 60%. All original variants are air transportable in the C-130. All variants are air-transportable in the C-17.
                
Original HEMTT models now have the suffix A0. Only the M984 wrecker was produced in A1 configuration. All models were produced in A2 configuration. The A3 suffix is applied to HEMTT technology demonstrators with a diesel-electric drive system. Current HEMTT production models have the suffix A4.

The M-1992 is a North Korean design. It is mounted on a ZSU-23-4 Shilka chassis. The twin guns are gas operated. Heating problems will limit the theoretical cyclic fire rates to lower practical values.
                
On the RWR it´s radar is very similar to the Shilka´s GUN DISH, due to the similar RWR signatures.
                
Against modern aircraft the M-1992´s accuracy is limited, but this SPAAG is widely spread in North Korean forces.

The MAZ-543 is the infamous mobile launcher for the Scud missile, which was the focus of great attention during the Gulf War. Because these vehicles attract a great deal of attention when they launch their single missiles, they must immediately change their locations or risk being attacked. Since the MAZ-543 is slow and completely unequipped to reply to any attack, its mobility is its only real means of defense.

Designed in 1972 to replace the venerable MB-326, the MB-339 is a relatively small, lightweight and agile aircraft. It serves in the Italian Airforces as a jet trainer, while being able to perform CAS, anti-tank, anti-ship and anti-helos roles. Its aerobatic capabilities made it the perfect choice for PAN (Pattuglia Acrobatica
Nazionale), the well known &quot;Frecce Tricolori&quot;, which has flown the A /PAN version since 1982.
                
In order to extend its service life, the A versions underwent a
mid-life update (various updated avionics and comms systems), thus being designated A MLU, while Macchi developed a new CD model (also referred as FD &quot;Full Digital trainer&quot;), almost identical externally, but with totally new avionics systems, a HUD, and MFDs, making the plane suitable to the needs of AMI (Aeronautica Militare Italiana) until at least 2015.
                
It is or has been in service in Italy, Saudi Arabia, New Zealand, Argentina, Dubai, Ghana, Malaysia, Nigeria and Peru.

The MD-500 Defender is little more than a modified civilian helicopter. As such, it is not heavily armed or armored. However, this type of aircraft is well suited to reconnaissance and patrol duties. The TOW missile armed variants also have some value as anti-armor units, although they must pick their targets carefully. The Defender poses a limited air-to-air threat at best. Even when equipped with Stinger missiles, these helicopters are generally better off making a run for it if they encounter any serious opposition. North Korea covertly purchased a large number of these helicopters. Since the South deploys the same helicopter, it is probable that the North will paint some of its own MD-500s with ROK markings and use them for infiltration and rear area attacks at the onset of any North Korea - South Korea conflict.

The Merkava is a main battle tank used by the Israel Defense Forces. The tank began development in 1973 and entered official service in 1978. Four main variants of the tank have been deployed. It was first used extensively in the 1982 Lebanon War. The name &quot;Merkava&quot; was derived from the IDF&apos;s initial development program name.
                
Design criteria include rapid repair of battle damage, survivability, cost-effectiveness and off-road performance. Following the model of contemporary self-propelled howitzers, the turret assembly is located closer to the rear than in most main battle tanks. With the engine in front, this layout is intended to grant additional protection against a frontal attack, especially for the personnel in the main hull, such as the driver. It also creates more space in the rear of the tank that allows increased storage capacity and a rear entrance to the main crew compartment allowing easy access under enemy fire. This allows the tank to be used as a platform for medical disembarkation, a forward command and control station, and an infantry fighting vehicle. The rear entrance&apos;s clamshell-style doors provide overhead protection when off- and on-loading cargo and personnel.
                
It was reportedly decided shortly before the beginning of the 2006 Lebanon War that the Merkava line would be discontinued within four years. However, on November 7, 2006, Haaretz reported that an Israeli General staff assessment had ruled of the Merkava Mark IV that &quot;if properly deployed, the tank can provide its crew with better protection than in the past&quot;, and deferred the decision on discontinuing the line. On August 16, 2013, Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya&apos;alon announced the decision to resume production of the Merkava main battle tank for the IDF Armored Corps.
                
The first Merkava Mk 4 Baraks are planned to begin trials and testing sometime in 2020. The new tank will use advanced artificial intelligence capability to reduce the team members&apos; workload and help them more accurately locate and strike targets. &quot;The tank&apos;s sensors, along with a 360-degree camera fitted outside the tank, will allow troops to remain in the tank at all times&quot;. A new smart helmet, similar to the one Elbit Systems&apos; has developed for the F-35, will allow the commander of the tank to see exactly what happens outside the tank. The task computer of the Merkava Mk 4 Barak will present all information to crew members, and to the other tanks and vehicles present in the field, and provide more precise and rapid fire closure, which will allow the new tank to eliminate the target before it disappears

Meteor is an active radar guided beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile (BVRAAM) developed by MBDA. Meteor offers a multi-shot capability against long range manoeuvring targets in a heavy electronic countermeasures (ECM) environment with range well in excess of 100 kilometres (62 mi).
                
It is intended to equip the Eurofighter Typhoon of the Royal Air Force (RAF), Royal Saudi Air Force, Luftwaffe, Spanish Air Force, Italian Air Force and Qatar Air Force, British and Italian F-35 Lightning IIs, Dassault Rafale of the French Air Force, Indian Air Force Qatar Air Force, and Egyptian Air Force and the Saab JAS 39 Gripen of the Swedish Air Force.
                
It entered service in the Swedish air force in April 2016, with the SwAF as the first operator of the missile due to most testing having been done on the JAS-39. It officially achieved initial operating capability (IOC) with Swedish air force Gripens in July 2016, and it was announced at the Farnborough Air Show that the Czech air force would soon reach IOC as well. According to MBDA, Meteor has three to six times the kinetic performance of current air-air missiles of its type. The key to Meteor&apos;s performance is a throttleable ducted rocket (ramjet) manufactured by Bayern-Chemie of Germany.
                
The MBDA solution
METEOR will engage air targets autonomously (whether fighters, bombers, transport aircraft, AWACS or cruise missiles) by using its active radar seeker by day or night and in all weather or dense electronic warfare environments.
                
METEOR will be developed under the prime contractorship of MBDA and the Meteor team comprising Europe&apos;s leading guided weapons companies.
                
METEOR&apos;s ramjet propulsion system will ensure a range in excess of 100 km and a speed of more than Mach 4. Even when launched from extreme stand-off ranges, the missile will have the energy in the end game to defeat fast, manoeuvring targets. To ensure total target destruction, the missile is equipped with both proximity and impact fuzes and a fragmentation warhead that is detonated at the optimum point to maximise lethality.
                
The METEOR system will be compatible with Eurofighter Typhoon, Rafale and Gripen and with other advanced European fighter aircraft.
Status of programme The METEOR contract has involved agreement by all six nations and was signed on 23t December 2002. This agreement covers a fixed price contract for the development of METEOR and production requirements will then be met on a nation by nation basis.
                
A full development programme, agreed by all six nations, is already in place and includes the key project milestones that will measure both progress and success. Development will be completed by 2010 followed by the introduction to service on Typhoon, Rafale and Gripen soon afterwards.

The MH-60R Seahawk is a multi-mission helicopter, operated by the US Navy. It is also referred as Romeo. It is a further development of the SH-60B Seahawk, which in turn is based on the US Army UH-60 Black Hawk. Development of the MH-60R began in 1993. It was designed to combine features of the SH-60B and SH-60F anti-submarine warfare helicopters. First low-rate initial production helicopters were remanufactured form the SH-60Bs. However subsequent helicopters were newly built. The MH-60R was first deployed in 2009. Currently this helicopter is used by the US Navy (over 100 units) and Royal Australian Navy.
                
Main missions of the MH-60R Seahawk are Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) and Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW). This helicopter can detect and track submarines and surface ships and attack with torpedoes and missiles.
                
Secondary missions are search and rescue, combat search and rescue, vertical replenishment, medical evacuation and insertion and extraction of special forces.
                
This helicopter is operated by a crew of 4 in anti-submarine warfare role and crew of 5 in anti-surface warfare role. It can also accommodate additional passengers.
                
The Seahawk has advanced mission systems and sensors. It carries advanced airborne active sonar, multi-mode search radar and nose-mounted forward-looking infrared (FLIR) turret. Its multi-mode search radar has an automatic periscope detection and discrimination capability. Also it carries air-launched sonobuoys. However magnetic anomaly detector suite was removed. Data is transferred via advanced airborne fleet data link.
                
The MH-60R has improved offensive capabilities comparing with SH-60B or SH-60F. It has stub wings and can carry two Mk.46, Mk.50 or Mk.54 light air-launched torpedoes, two AGM-119B Penguin anti-ship missiles or four AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-surface missiles. A single door-mounted 7.62 mm mm or 12.7 mm machine gun can be fitted.
                
The MH-60R has two General Electric T700-GE-401C turboshaft engines, developing 1 900 shp each. These are the same engines of the SH-60B.
                
The MH-60R has a hinged tail, that can be folded in order to reduce footprint aboard ships. Cockpit instrumentation and displays are similar to that of the MH-60S.
                
The MH-60R, as well as all other US Navy H-60 series helicopters, has a rescue hoist for search and rescue missions. For vertical replenishment tasks it can be fitted with a 2.7 t capacity cargo hook.
                
For extended range this helicopter can carry external fuel tanks. The helicopter has an integrated self-defense system.

The first two models were the Mi-8P and Mi-8S with rectangular cabin windows, and were intended primarily for civil use, though both saw some military service: the former was basically a convertible 28-passenger/freight transport and the latter an 11-passenger airliner.
The Mi-8T was developed with a powerplant of two TV-117 turboshafts, each rated at 1,500 shp (1,118 kW), as a utility transport with round windows and rail-mounted seats, and although developed initially for civil use was in fact built in very considerably larger numbers for the military with more powerful TV2-117A engines. The cabin is 7 ft 8.25 in (2.34 m) wide and 5 ft 10.75 in (1.80 m) high, with a length of 20 ft 10.25 in (6.36 m) in the passenger model and 17 ft 6.25 in (5.34 m) in the freight model. It is accessed by a large port-side forward sliding door as well as clamshell rear doors. Cargo handling can be facilitated by the installation of the optional 331 lbs (150 kg) capacity winch.
These two sub variants have the same weapons capability as the standard Mi-8T, but the rocket launchers are often of the B-8V20A type each carrying twenty 3.15 in (80 mm) S-8 unguided rockets, packing a considerably heavier punch than the older 2.17 in (55 mm) S-5 type.
Some of the helicopters have been further improved in capability to Mi-17 standard, and are distinguishable by the relocation of the tail rotor from the starboard to the port side of the tail pylon.

This heavy assault helicopter (NATO designation &quot;Hind&quot;) can bear 4 &quot;Swatter&quot; anti-tank missiles plus 4 under-wing pylons loaded with rocket launchers or other deadly stores, and can still ferry up to 8 combat troops into battle. The Hind&apos;s 4-barrel, 12.7mm gun is mounted in a swivel turret and is slaved to the gunner&apos;s targeting system, providing instant firepower. While it packs a great deal of ordnance, the Mi-24 is an easy mark for surface-to-air missiles. As with other helicopters, it is little more than a target in the eyes of a modern fighter pilot. The Hind&apos;s only real defense is the low altitude at which it operates; missiles may lose their lock in ground clutter, and prudent fighter pilots rarely risk flying below 100 feet.

The Mi-28 combat helicopter has been developed by Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant and is known by the NATO codename Havoc. In August 1996 Mil rolled out a prototype of the day and night capable version, the Mi-28N Night Havoc. The first production Mi-28N took its first flight in April 2004 and began flight testing with the Russian Air Force in June 2005.
                
The Russian Air Force has plans to procure up to 60 of this variant, now called the Mi-28NE Night Hunter. Three were ordered in 2005 and 16 more in 2006 for delivery by 2008. The first production aircraft was delivered in May 2006 and began formal acceptance testing in September 2006. Five aircraft are involved in the testing which is scheduled to conclude in early 2008.
                
Mi-28 can fly at a maximum speed of 300km/h, can fly rearwards and sideways at speeds up to 100km/h and is able to hover turn at 45° a second.
                
The helicopter design is based on the conventional pod and boom configuration, with a tail rotor. The main rotor head has elastomeric bearings and the main rotor blades are made from composite materials. The tail rotor is designed on a biplane configuration, with independently controlled X-shaped blades. A new design of all plastic rotor blades, which can sustain hits from 30mm shells, has been installed on the Night Havoc Mi-28N helicopter.
                
The helicopter has non-retractable tricycle tail-wheel type landing gear. The energy-absorbing landing gear and seats protect the crew in a crash landing or in a low-altitude vertical fall. The crew are able to survive a vertical fall of up to 12m/s. The Mi-28 has a fully armoured cabin, including the windshield, which withstands impact by 7.62mm and 12.7mm bullets and 20mm shell fragments.
                
The Mi-28A has small swept-back, mid-mounted stub-wings with four suspension units. Countermeasures pods are mounted on the wingtips. The helicopter can be armed with a mixture of air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles, unguided rockets, and podded guns.
                
The Mi-28 and Mi-28N Night Havoc are armed with Shturm and Ataka anti-tank missiles supplied by the Kolumna Design Bureau (KBM). Up to 16 anti-tank missiles can be mounted on the helicopter. Shturm is a short-range, radio command-guided missile. The Ataka missile&apos;s guidance is by narrow radar beam, and maximum range of the missile is 8km. The missile has a tandem shaped-charge warhead for penetration of 950mm to 1,000mm armour.
                
The helicopter can also carry four containers, each with 20 80mm unguided rockets or with five 122mm rockets. The helicopter can alternatively carry containers with grenade launchers, 23mm guns, 12.7mm and 7.62mm machine guns, aerial bombs, and incendiary tanks. The helicopter is equipped with a turreted 2A42 30mm cannon, stabilised in two axes, with a muzzle velocity of 1,000m/s.
                
The pilot uses a helmet-mounted target designator, which allocates the target to the navigator&apos;s surveillance and fire control system. The navigator / weapons officer is then able to deploy guided weapons or guns against the target. The targeting system follows the direction of the pilot&apos;s eyes.
                
The integrated surveillance and fire control system has two optical channels providing wide and narrow fields of view, a narrow-field-of-view optical television channel, and laser rangefinder. The system can move within 110° in azimuth and from +13° to -40° in elevation.
                
The Mi-28A helicopter is powered by two TV3-117VMA turboshaft engines, fitted on either side of the fuselage. It is equipped with an auxiliary power unit for self-contained operation. The thermal signature of the helicopter has been reduced by a factor of 2.5 times compared to its predecessor, the Mi-24.

Since the 90&apos;s, MBDA and the French Air Force have been developing the MICA which is an air-to-air missile that was to revolutionize air combat because it is the only missile in the world capable of performing all air defense missions.
                
The pilot can engage several targets simultaneously, in close up fighting or in self-defense from all directions, while maintaining maximum efficiency within an electronic warfare environment and with saturation jamming. These elements give it a very good cost/efficiency ratio compared with existing specialized missiles. Another advantage of MICA&apos;s innovative concept is its flexibility to be guided by an active radar electromagnetic homing head (MICA RF) or by an infrared imagery homing head (MICA IR). The IR homing head is unique for a missile with this range, and its many features include an excellent angular resolution (dual band imagery) and total stealth: the passive homing head enables absolutely &quot;silent&quot; interceptions when it is used with an OSF (Front Sector Optronics). The pilot can also use the MICA IR for discrete optronics monitoring, in addition to the active monitoring radar on his aircraft throughout the mission duration.
                
MICA&apos;s homing system makes it both independent and versatile. When the target has been designated by the launching aircraft radar, it makes its first flight phase in inertial guidance, possibly refreshed, and then latches onto the target in flight using its homing head. Thus it has a &quot;Fire and Forget&quot; capability, so that the pilot can fire several missiles simultaneously on different targets. With two available homing head versions RF and IR, the pilot can handle all eventualities. Each of the two types of homing head has its own counter-countermeasures system.
                
MICA has excellent maneuverability, confirmed in more than 100 test firings carried out so far. A jet deviation system combined with aerodynamic control surfaces and its long fin provides MICA with
exceptional agility (load factors up to 50 kg).
                
Lightweight and compact, MICA was originally designed as a &quot;multi-aircraft&quot; missile that could easily be integrated onto any modern fighter aircraft. It does not significantly reduce the aircraft speed or its aerodynamic characteristics; a significant number may be carried under the fuselage or under the wings, and it may be fired by ejection or by rail.

Since the 90&apos;s, MBDA and the French Air Force have been developing the MICA which is an air-to-air missile that was to revolutionize air combat because it is the only missile in the world capable of performing all air defense missions.
                
The pilot can engage several targets simultaneously, in close up fighting or in self-defense from all directions, while maintaining maximum efficiency within an electronic warfare environment and with saturation jamming. These elements give it a very good cost/efficiency ratio compared with existing specialized missiles. Another advantage of MICA&apos;s innovative concept is its flexibility to be guided by an active radar electromagnetic homing head (MICA RF) or by an infrared imagery homing head (MICA IR). The IR homing head is unique for a missile with this range, and its many features include an excellent angular resolution (dual band imagery) and total stealth: the passive homing head enables absolutely &quot;silent&quot; interceptions when it is used with an OSF (Front Sector Optronics). The pilot can also use the MICA IR for discrete optronics monitoring, in addition to the active monitoring radar on his aircraft throughout the mission duration.
                
MICA&apos;s homing system makes it both independent and versatile. When the target has been designated by the launching aircraft radar, it makes its first flight phase in inertial guidance, possibly refreshed, and then latches onto the target in flight using its homing head. Thus it has a &quot;Fire and Forget&quot; capability, so that the pilot can fire several missiles simultaneously on different targets. With two available homing head versions RF and IR, the pilot can handle all eventualities. Each of the two types of homing head has its own counter-countermeasures system.
                
MICA has excellent maneuverability, confirmed in more than 100 test firings carried out so far. A jet deviation system combined with aerodynamic control surfaces and its long fin provides MICA with exceptional agility (load factors up to 50 kg).
                
Lightweight and compact, MICA was originally designed as a &quot;multi-aircraft&quot; missile that could easily be integrated onto any modern fighter aircraft. It does not significantly reduce the aircraft speed or its aerodynamic characteristics; a significant number may be carried under the fuselage or under the wings, and it may be fired by ejection or by rail.

		<DescriptionData>
A 1950s-vintage aircraft, the MiG-19 is a dependable aircraft with a tough structure and heavy guns. Unfortunately for its pilots, the likelihood of a Farmer getting into sufficient range to use those guns is small. While the Farmer is fairly maneuverable at low airspeeds, it is comparatively slow and its avionics are either outdated or nonexistent. Though the MiG-19 is aging, its weaponry is not. Its Alkali radar-homing air-to-air missiles and Atoll heat-seeking air-to-air missiles pose a real threat. Worse, if it can get in close enough, the Farmer&apos;s three 30mm cannons can tear lighter, more modern aircraft to shreds. The MiG-19, along with the Shenyang F-6 and J-6 (its Chinese copies), serves in the air forces of the Soviet Union, Cuba, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Pakistan and dozens of other nations.

The MiG-21 exemplifies the Soviet engineering philosophy that required aircraft to make immediate use of new breakthroughs in weapons and electronics. Entering service in 1957, it has been continually upgraded and was still considered a primary threat in the 1970s when given a new radar and engine. Still quite fast, maneuverable and refitted with the latest armament, the Fishbed remains a respectable air threat. It should be noted, however, that its maneuverability is in a completely different class than modern designs. At low speeds, the Fishbed can almost hold its own; above Mach 0.9 it is badly outclassed. Versions of the MiG-21 serve in the air forces of the Soviet Union, Bangladesh, Cuba, India, Egypt, Iraq and Syria as well as numerous former and present Soviet allies.
In 1961, Russia licensed MiG-21F manufacture to the Chinese, which then started off their own family of Fishbed variants, the J-7. This plane is build from Chinese components and has many improvements over the original Russian design. The most recent is the MiG-21MF equivalent J-7III, which entered PLA and Navy Service in 1992. It is equipped with an JL-7 radar instead of the normal Spin Scan.

&quot;Flogger&quot; is the NATO designation given to both the MiG-23 and its strike-dedicated cousin, the MiG-27. Both planes are built around the same basic swing-wing design. The MiG-23 entered service in the early 1970s in astonishing numbers due to its ease of production and low cost. Unfortunately for NATO, this low cost did not mean low performance. However, the E series export version is considerably less threatening. It has a downgraded engine and fire control radar, and it doesn&apos;t have an infrared system or Doppler navigation. Its maneuverability is on par with the F-4 and other planes of its time, but against modern fighter craft the Flogger&apos;s best tactic is to keep a distance and use its missiles. The variable-sweep wing design, however, does allow the Flogger to maximize its limited performance at all speeds. Its maximum, unswept wingspan is 45 ft. 10 in.
The MiG-23ML Flogger G is an interceptor variant.

The Foxbat is a pure interceptor. Designed solely for speed and climbing, it has impressive top speed, acceleration, rate-of-climb and maximum ceiling statistics. But the MiG-25&apos;s maneuverability is less than impressive. Psychologically, the MiG-25 posed a serious threat to the United States before the first production model had even been tested. Western intelligence sources vastly overrated the MiG-25&apos;s capabilities during its development, and as a result spent enormous amounts of money developing the F-15 to counter the mythical Soviet superplane. After the myth was dispelled by a defecting Foxbat pilot and his plane in 1976, the Soviet Union began exporting the MiG-25 as an interceptor and high-speed, high-altitude reconnaissance platform. The MiG-25 serves in the air forces of the Soviet Union, Iraq, Syria, India, Egypt and a number of former Soviet allies.

MiG-27 &quot;Flogger-D&quot;: Derived from the MiG-23B as a fully optimized ground-attack warplane and entering service in the second half of the 1970s, the MiG-27 retains its predecessor&apos;s basic airframe, complete with the Utkanos (duck nose) forward fuselage section, but adds a strengthened landing gear with larger low-pressure tires and reflects its dedicated lower-speed/lower-altitude combat role in the introduction of fixed rather than variable-geometry air inlets (without movable splitter plates) and a simple two-position (on/off) rather than fully variable nozzle for the same R-29B-300 engine as used in the MiG-23BN, but in this application providing reduced afterburning thrust.
The nose section has a fair degree of armor protection and seats the pilot relatively higher than in the MiG-23, offering him far better fields of vision to the front, sides and below over the flattened nose. Compared to the MiG-23BM, the MiG-27 has a new version of the PrNK-23 navigation and weapon-aiming system, incorporating a navigation computer, a new automatic flight planning system, an IR jammer and the new Fone laser ranger.
The disposable weapon capability was improved to a maximum of 8,818 lbs (4,000 kg) carried on the increased total of seven hardpoints, but the MiG-23B series&apos; comparatively inadequate 23 mm two-barrel cannon was retained. Further ground-attack firepower can be provided, however, by the external carriage of cannon pods such as the UPK-23, carrying a 23 mm GSh-23L two-barrel cannon with about 250 rounds of ammunition.
The PrNK-23K system provides automatic flight control, gun firing and weapon release. It has separate modes for gun firing and weapon release in a maneuvering flight, and for automatic preprogrammed navigation to a target that can then be attacked automatically in night or adverse-weather conditions.
The main production model of the MiG-27K is identifiable by its deeper and wider nose, accommodating a less sloped laser ranger and marked-target seeker window under a pronounced lip, and by the removal of the external armor on the cockpit sides.
                          
MiG-27D &quot;Flogger-J&quot;: This revised version was produced from 1981 with a maximum take-off weight of 45,569 lbs (20,670 kg) and the improved PrNK-23M navigation/attack system, characterized by its more numerous and more flexible operating modes, and incorporating the latest Klen laser ranger, with provision for a new type of reconnaissance pod (three cameras and other sensors), provision for the AS-14 &quot;Kedge&quot; laser-guided ASM, provision for the SPPU-22 pod with 260 rounds of ammunition for the 23 mm GSh-23L cannon whose two barrels can be depressed so that ground targets can be strafed as the warplane continues in level flight, and other changes such as small leading-edge root extensions (probably accommodating ECM equipment) lacking the earlier variant&apos;s conical fairings (missile-guidance antennae) on the leading edges of the wing gloves.
MiG-27M &quot;Flogger-J2&quot;: This is an improved development of the MiG-27D with a wider laser window fitted in the flattened underside of the nose rather than in a narrow bulged fairing, a TV tracker and laser designator (used with optronically guided weapons) in a large fairing farther aft on the underside of the nose, and repositioned pitot and ILS antennae.
Soviet production of the MiG-27 series ended with this variant in the mid-1980s, but the type is still built under license in India as the HAL Bahadur with a HAL-built R-29B-300 turbojet, rated at 17,637 lb st (78.45 kN) dry and 25,353 lb st (112.77 kN) with afterburner, a maximum take-off weight of 39,683 lbs (18,000 kg), a ferry range of 1,349 nm (1,553 miles; 2,500 km) with three drop tanks, and a radius of 390 nm (242 miles; 210 km) on a lo-lo-lo attack mission.
In the late 1980s it was revealed that a MiG-27M variant had been evaluated for possible naval use on the CIS&apos;s new conventional aircraft carriers.

The Fulcrum is a fairly new Soviet-built fighter, and takes advantage of some of the same advances in avionics and aerodynamic design found in the F-16 and F/A-18. Departing somewhat from the standard Soviet doctrine of simplicity in design and operation, the MiG-29 uses avionics only slightly less complex than its modern Western opponents. Sporting leading-edge root extensions (LERX) such as those seen on the F/A-18, the Fulcrum is maneuverable, thus matching or outperforming the best of its opponents in most situations. Its look-down, shoot-down radar can detect and lock onto targets beyond visual range and guide the latest air-to-air missiles to them. A truly multi-role fighter, the MiG-29 can also carry a healthy ordnance load for performing ground attacks. When encountered, the MiG-29 should be treated as a primary air threat. The MiG-29 serves in the air forces of the Soviet Union, Iraq, Cuba, Syria, India, North Korea and other nations.

The Soviet general staff asked for the essay about &quot;PFI-Perspektivnyi Frontowoi Distribute&quot; (future front fighter plane) as a counterpart to the American &quot;FX&quot; program in the late sixties. From the American &quot;FX&quot; program the F 15 went in service 1974. The Soviet program parted 1971 into the &quot;TFI&quot; (tjasholui = heavily) and the &quot;LFI&quot; (ljochki = easily). The Su 27 resulted from the TFI which was put in service in 1986 and the MiG 29 from the &quot;LFI&quot; which was put in service 1983.
The new airplane got the NATO code name &quot;Fulcrum A&quot;. The tasks of the MiG 29 were predefined as follows : Operation of remote airfields, establish air superiority and be able to do some force protection escort as well as limited close air support for ground forces. It was developed to replace both the MiG 21 and the MiG 23. Right from the beginning the designers put main emphasis on high manoeuvrability. The aerodynamic concept provided the integral style of fuselage and wings in which 40% of the lift is produced by the main section of the fuselage. The air intakes were put below the fuselage to ensure an undisturbed airflow at high angles of attacks into the jet engines.
The design was described as product 9 (also in the NVA). Out of 25 planned 19 prototypes were produced. (the prototypes had the numbers 901 to 925) The first prototype 901 (temp. NATO code name &quot;RAM L&quot;) went airborne in October 1977 followed of the second in June 1978. The first Two-seater was the third prototype it made its first flight in 1981. The first group of prototypes still caused big problems and so the second and fourth airplane already crashed in 1980. After considerable changes board number 925 was finally produced as the product 9-12. 1982 the series production finally started. In April 1983 the training centre in Libizk was equipped with MiG 29 and in August 1983 the first combat squadron in Kubinka. 1986 the USSR already started with the first exports. Altogether over 800 MiG 29 were delivered to the Soviet forces and only 500 were produced for export. 1990 the production of the MiG 29 ended for the GUS forces. There may have been some productions of MiG 29 UB and SD or N for export in 1995.
The MiG-29G had it&apos;s first flight in western world in Finland in 1986.
MiG-29G is the German name for the ex-East German Mig29 Fulcrum A model 9.12A&apos;s that were converted to Fulcrum B model 9.12B and obtained after the reunion of Germany. They have been sold to Poland in 2003.

The Mikoyan MiG-29M (NATO reporting name &quot;Fulcrum-F&quot;) is a mature development of the MiG-29M/M2 and MiG-29K/KUB technology. Formely known as the MiG-33, it was developed from the Mikoyan MiG-29 (NATO: &quot;Fulcrum&quot;) fighter jet during mid-1980s. The MiG-29M is sometimes called the Super Fulcrum.
                
In the mid-1980s, a development of the original MiG-29 was proposed to meet the Soviet western front line requirement. It was required to be a multi-role fighter for the front line defensive air force to gain offensive strike ability. This development resulted in a single seat and a double seat variant. The proposal was then grounded as a result of shift in military strategy. The model was named MiG-33 and later with the MiG-29ME designation for export market in the mid 1990s. A twin seat model of the standard, which also commonly known as the MiG-29MRCA was the MAPO-MiG&apos;s primary contender for many international fighter aircraft bids, later evolved into the Mikoyan MiG-35. Six of these models were built before 1990. They were constantly upgraded with various components and one of them received experimental vector thrust engines which eventually became the MiG-29OVT. The model was again renamed as MiG-29M. The MiG-29M/M2 now belongs to the &quot;New unified family&quot; instead of the &quot;MiG-29 fighters family&quot; which comprise the older variants.
                
RAC MiG engineers are putting their effort constantly to upgrade the model for better performance, seeking a possible sale of the aircraft. The innovation is focused on aerodynamics improvements, fly-by-wire technology, stealth feature, increased fuel capacity and in-flight refueling solutions, more weight load, and well established open architect for application of foreign equipment. Together with the success of MiG-29K/KUB and MiG-35, the MiG-29M/M2 also took advantage of new technologies, such as the new enhanced thrust smokeless engines. New reliability measures resulted in a flight hour cost decrease by about 2.5 times and capable of on- condition maintenance. These new technologies gave the aircraft contemporary features to fourth and fifth generation fighters in all aspects, and most important, to offer a true multi-role capability to the aircraft.
                
Furthermore, the RAC MiG engineers have also developed a complete set of training simulators to help pilots master the sophisticate controls of the new aircraft. The simulators&apos; interactive computer-based training systems offer full-mission motion simulations.
                
The MiG-29M/M2 aircraft is a revision of the basic MiG-29. It achieved a more robust multi-role capability with enhanced use of air-to-air and air-to-ground high-precision weapons. It also featured considerably increased combat range owing to an increase in its internal fuel capacity. Along with a better pilot-to-aircraft interface in the cockpit, a digital three-channel fourfold redundant fly-by-wire system, improved navigation, radio communications, electronic countermeasures, monitoring and recording systems, and optronic and reconnaissance pods, have improved overall aircraft performance considerably.
                
There are few vital changes took place during the development of the MiG-33. The redesigned airframe was constructed from a lightweight aluminum-lithium alloy to increase thrust-to-weight ratio. Air intakes&apos; geometry is being revised, removed the upper intake louvres to make way for more fuel in the LERXs, mesh screens introduced to prevent foreign object damage (FOD) and enlarged inlet dimensions for higher airflow. At the back of the aircraft featured an enlarged spine for more fuel capacity and a dorsal air break. Radome and canopy were redesign to give space for avionic upgrades. Aerodynamics were also revised. The wings increased span and aileron, while the tail fins revised trailing edges.
                
The RD-33MK, the latest revised of the RD-33 were introduced. The new engines has a 7% higher horsepower in compare to the baseline model due to the usage of modern materials on the cooled blades, hence provide a higher thrust at 9,000 kgf. In response to long time criticism, new engines are smokeless and contain improvements that reduce its infrared visibility. Thrust vectoring nozzles are now offered upon customer&apos;s request.
                
The aircraft is built with an in-flight-refueling (IFR) probe and is able to carry three fuel drop tanks. The redesigned airframe also significantly increased internal fuel capacity in the dorsal spine and LERXs fuel tanks. These give the aircraft of single seat an operation range of 2,000 km with internal fuel, 3,200 km with three fuel drop tanks, and 6,000 km with three drop tanks and in-flight-refueling.
                
The cockpit has been redesigned to incorporate contemporary features. While some analogue instruments have been retained, two monochrome liquid crystal (LCD) multi-function displays (MFD) have been introduced and new weapon controls have been incorporated in a HOTAS concept. Other new features include the Zhuk-ME radar, an infra-red search and track (IRST) system and a helmet-mounted target designation system (early HMD).
                
Main upgrades consists the Zhuk-ME pulse-Doppler airbone radar, along with revised IRST systems, helmet-mounted target designation system and electronic countermeasures. New radar capable of detect air targets at ranges up to 120 km, track-while-scan of ten targets and attack of four targets at a time. In scanning surface targets, the radar detection range of destroyer-type target is 250 km and that of missile launcher-type target is 150 km. Hence beyond visual range (BVR) engage is greatly enhanced.

The MiG-29 &quot;Fulcrum&quot; (&quot;Tochka Opori&quot; in Russian) was designed and built to be a single-seat, supersonic, all-weather, air superiority fighter, representing, with the MiG-31 &quot;Foxhound&quot;, the latest and perhaps last fighter production items from the Mikoyan Design Bureau. The primary role of the MiG-29 is to destroy air targets at distances from 60 to 200 kilometers (30 to 110 nm) at all altitudes, on all profiles, in any weather, and under all ECM conditions. In addition, the basic MiG-29 is capable of limited air-to-ground operations and in advanced versions, has been optimized to attack both stationary and moving targets with precision guided munitions.
Chief Designer Waldenberg praised the MiG-29S as one of the two newest Mikoyan models just being introduced for export worldwide.
The core difference in the upgraded Fulcrum A with the &quot;fat back&quot; modification and the production MiG-29S start with the improvements in the flight control system where four new computers provide better stability augmentation and controllability with an increase in AOA and G-limits. The MiG-29S adds 2 degrees more to the maximum angle-of-attack (AOA). Its improved mechanical-hydraulic flight control system then allows for greater control surface deflections.
The production MiG-29S further increased the internal fuel due to new fuel cells in the wing-LEX/fuselage interface area (1500 liters/2576 pounds).
Inboard underwing hardpoints have been upgraded to allow for a tandem pylon arrangement (like a Multiple-Ejector-Rack), which results in a larger ordnance payload of 4,000 kg (8,820 lbs). The overall max-gross weight has been raised to 20,000 kg (44,000 lbs).
The GSh-30-1 cannon also had its expended round ejector port modified to allow firing while the centerline tank was still attached.
Underwing missile hardpoints can be increased from the normal six (three on each wing) to eight, and all carry the new R-77 (AA-12 &quot;Adder&quot;) active-radar long range air-to-air missile or a mix of air-to-ground missiles. In JDW (19th Sep. &apos;92, p. 18), Waldenberg was quoted as saying that this MiG-29 improvement would allow for missiles like the R-27E (AA-10 &quot;Alamo&quot;), which has 1.5 times the range of the basic model R-27 &quot;Alamo&quot; due to its larger rocket motor. These long-burn variants have previously only been found on the Su-27 &quot;Flanker&quot;.

The Mig31 Foxhound is a very different aircraft to the Mig25 Foxbat that it was modelled from. It is an all weather, all altitude, two seater interceptor with advanced digital avionics. It&apos;s airframe was extensively redesigned for supersonice flight at low level, for this the welded nickel steel content was reduced from 80% to 49%, with 16% titanium, 33% aluminium alloy and 2% composites. The first Mig31 flew in 1975 with a N007 Zaslon radar that was the first electronically scanned phased array type radar to enter service in the World. It could scan 198.4 km forward and track 10 targets simultaniously. This radar could also tract and engage target flying behind and below the Aircraft.
The Mig 31 includes the new SBI-16 Zaslon radar radar. What makes the Mig 31 such an effective aircraft is not features such as agility (which it is not renoun for) or speed (which it has plenty of!) but in it&apos;s weapons system of which the radar is a major part. The Zaslon antenna is of the fixed type, instead of being mechanically directed the radar beam is moved electronically. This allows the full fuselage diameter to be used for the antenna, since antenna diameter and effective operating range are directly related it is a great advantage. Electronic steerage of the radar beam is faster than can be performed mechanically, it is also more accurate. All signal processing is digital. The FOXHOUND carries the long-range AA-9 air-to-air missiles, and can engage 4 different targets simuitaneouly with the M-9.4
, the mission computer automatically selects the four most threatening targets. The MiG-31 can engage targets spread over a greater area than can its Western equivalent, the F-14.
Due to the Mig31&apos;s impressive radar, speed and ability to carry long range missiles they can cover a large swathe of territory. In a flight of four aircraft Mig31s can cover a 900km front, sharing information through a digital datalink. They can also act as an AWACs directing other fighters to targets. For emmission free detection the Mig 31 is deployed with an IRST. On the standard Mig31 this is semi retractable but on the Mig31M it is non retractable. This long range fighter (fitted for in flight refueling) is one of the most expensive fighters that Russia has produced. It is used solely by Russia. The cockpits were upgraded in the Mig 31M with a number of Cathode Ray Tubes (CRT) and an increased number of missiles.
By 1987 over 150 FOXHOUNDs were operationally deployed at several locations from the Arkhangelsk area in the northwestern USSR to the Soviet Far East. The FOXHOUND is dedicated to the homeland air defense mission.
The first stage of tests of the upgraded MiG-31BM high-speed multifunctional long-range jet fighter were completed in mid-1999. The main difference between the MiG-31P (Foxhound, according to the NATO classification) and the new MiG-31BM multifunctional air strike system is that the latter is capable of destroying both air and ground targets. The designers and manufacturers of the MiG-31 hope that the new modification will result in international sales. The upgraded MiG-31BM is fitted with a powerful onboard computer system and a radar with a phased array which will allow the pilot to simultaneously activate the air-to-air and air-to-surface missile fire modes. When working with air targets, the MiG-31BM is capable of intercepting up to 24 targets simultaneously.

The Nike Hercules was the only nuclear-armed surface-to-air weapon, which was operational with the U.S. Army. Development of an improved Nike missile began in 1952, with the primary goal to develop a missile with a significantly higher performance than MIM-3 Nike Ajax (then known simply as Nike), which could still be used with the existing Nike ground equipment. After it had been shown that the Nike Ajax could not be equipped with then existing nuclear warheads, nuclear armament became another goal for the new missile. The SAM-A-25 Nike B program was formally established in June 1953. As with Nike Ajax, Western Electric was prime contractor, and Douglas was responsible for the missile airframe.
      
The Nike B (renamed Nike Hercules on 15 December 1956) used many components of the Nike I (Nike Ajax). The booster consisted of four Nike Ajax boosters, and the original design used 4 of Ajax' liqued-fuel rockets as sustainer propulsion. However, the first flight tests with the liquid-fuel sustainer in 1955 proved very troublesome, and a solid-fueled sustainer rocket was eventually used. The first successful interception of a drone target occurred in 1956, and in 1957 the new solid-fuel sustainer flew for the first time. Nike Hercules used the same command guidance as the MIM-3 Nike Ajax, with essentially the same ground components.
      
The first production Nike Hercules missiles were delivered in 1958, and quickly replaced the Ajax on many Nike sites. By then, the Nike Hercules had been designated as Guided Missile, Air Defense M6. The M6 could be equipped with either an M17 (a.k.a. T45) blast-fragmentation warhead, or a W-31 nuclear fission warhead with yield selectable as 2 kT or 40 kT. The missile performance was such that even very high-flying bombers could not escpe the Nike Hercules. Capability against low-level targets remained rather limited, however.

The Nike Hercules was once an integral part of America&apos;s anti-nuclear forces, but it has since been removed from U.S. service. The Hercules is a high-altitude missile, capable of hitting targets as high as 28 miles. This ceiling, combined with its high speed and great range, make it a deadly threat against any aircraft, especially bombers.
                
It was normally armed with the W31 nuclear warhead, but could also be fitted with a conventional warhead for export use. It had the ability to attack high-flying supersonic targets and with its small nuclear warhead that could attack entire formations of aircraft with a single missile.

The Raytheon MIM-23 Hawk is an American medium-range surface-to-air missile. It was designed to be a much more mobile counterpart to the MIM-14 Nike Hercules, trading off range and altitude capability for a much smaller size and weight. Its low-level performance was greatly improved over Nike through the adoption of new radars and a continuous wave semi-active radar homing guidance system.
      
Hawk was originally intended to attack aircraft, especially those flying at medium and low altitudes. It entered service with the Army in this role in 1959. In 1971 it underwent a major improvement program as the Improved Hawk, or I-Hawk, which made several improvements to the missile and replaced all of the radar systems with new models. Improvements continued throughout the next twenty years, adding improved ECCM, a potential home-on-jam feature, and in 1995, a new warhead that made it capable against short-range tactical missiles. Jane's reported that the original system's single shot kill probability was 0.56; I-Hawk improved this to 0.85.
      
Hawk was superseded by the MIM-104 Patriot in US Army service by 1994. The last US user was the US Marine Corps, who used theirs until 2002 when they were replaced with the man-portable short-range FIM-92 Stinger. The missile was also produced outside the US in Western Europe, Japan and Iran. The US never used the Hawk in combat, but it has been employed numerous times by other nations. Approximately 40,000 of the missiles were produced. 
       
The missile is propelled by a dual thrust motor, with a boost phase and a sustain phase. The MIM-23A missiles were fitted with an M22E8 motor which burns for 25 to 32 seconds. The MIM-23B and later missiles are fitted with an M112 motor with a 5 second boost phase and a sustain phase of around 21 seconds. The M112 motor has greater thrust, thus increasing the engagement envelope. The Hawk missile has a slender cylindrical body and four long chord clipped delta-wings, extending from mid-body to the slightly tapered boat-tail. Each wing has a trailing-edge control surface. The MIM-23A has a minimum engagement range of 2 kilometres , a maximum range of 25 km, a minimum engagement altitude of 60 metres, a maximum engagement altitude of 11,000 m and a warhead of 54 kg HE blast/fragmentation.
The MIM-23B has has a minimum engagement range of 1.5 kilometres, a maximum range of 35 km, a minimum engagement altitude of 60 metres, a maximum engagement altitude of 18,000 m and a warhead of 75 kg HE blast/fragmentation. Other improved missiles are also available as the MIM-23C, MIM-23D, MIM-23E/F, MIM-23G/H, MIM-23K/J and MIM-23L/M.

Loaded on triple missile launch trailers, the HAWK is a serious aerial deterrent. Despite having first started service in the early 1960s, this system nonetheless downed approximately 24 Iraqi aircraft during Iraq&apos;s thrust into Kuwait. One reason for the HAWK&apos;s success is its reliance on multiple types of radar and targeting systems.

The Patriot missile is equipped with a track-via-missile (TVM) guidance system. Midcourse correction commands are transmitted to the guidance system from the mobile engagement control center. The target acquisition system in the missile acquires the target in the terminal phase of flight and transmits the data using the TVM downlink via the ground radar to the engagement control station for final course correction calculations. The course correction commands are transmitted to the missile via the missile track command uplink. The high-explosive 90kg warhead is situated behind the terminal guidance section. The range of the missile is 70km and maximum altitude is greater than 24km. The minimum flight time is the time to arm the missile, which is less than nine seconds, and the maximum flight time is less than three and a half minutes.
                       
The latest generation of Patriot launcher uses the PAC-3 missile produced by the Company Lockheed Martin. The PAC-3 Missile is a high velocity interceptor that defeats incoming targets by direct, body-to-body impact. PAC-3 Missiles, when deployed in a Patriot battery, will significantly increase the Patriot system's firepower, since 16 PAC-3s load-out on a Patriot launcher, compared with four of the legacy Patriot PAC-2 missiles. One hundred percent effective in Operation Iraqi Freedom, PAC-3 Missiles are now deployed with U.S. and allied forces.

The Patriot is a dual-purpose land-based missile. First, it is able to intercept aircraft by detonating near them and showering the area with high-velocity metal fragments. Secondly, it is capable of intercepting and deflecting tactical ballistic missiles (TBMs). The Patriot missile system has the ability to track 100 potential targets simultaneously, while at the same time determining which targets are hostile. The Patriot had the opportunity to demonstrate its effectiveness against tactical missiles during the Gulf War while fighting Scud missiles; the U.S. army claimed a high success rate of interception. However, performance reviews from other groups were not as complimentary.

The Dassault Mirage 2000 is a French multirole, single-engine fourth-generation jet fighter manufactured by Dassault Aviation. It was designed in the late 1970s as a lightweight fighter to replace the Mirage III for the French Air Force (Armée de l'Air). The Mirage 2000 evolved into a multirole aircraft with several variants developed, with sales to a number of nations. It was later developed into the Mirage 2000N and 2000D strike variants, the improved Mirage 2000-5 and several export variants. Over 600 aircraft were built and it has been in service with nine nations.

The Mirage 2000 began life as a fighter to re-equip France&apos;s interceptor squadrons, but has emerged as a true multi-role performer. The Delta winged aircraft has been declined in many versions for air superiority (2000C) as well as conventionnal bomber (2000D) and nuclear capable fighter bomber (2000N) and multi role aircraft (2000-5). The mirage 2000 is the backbone of France armee de l&apos;air with more than 300 aircraft equiping front line squadrons. It was also widely esported. Greece, Taiwan and some middle east countries uses the 2000 in various roles.

Intended as a sucessor to the Mirage III/5/50, the mirage F1 provided the backbone of French air defenses for a vital decade. When they were freed from air defence responsibilities, Armee de l&apos;air Mirages F1s were switched to the air to ground role to begin a second career. Overseas, Mirages F1s remains in widespread use, often in the world&apos;s more troubled areas. Fast a deadly, the Mirage F1s remains a force with which to be reckoned.
Air defense variants carry short range missiles on wingtips (matra magic), medium range missile (matra 530) on inboard pylons and a centreline fuel tank (1200L)

The French Mirage III was one of the most successful aircraft of the Cold War era. The design began as a small light interceptor but soon grew into a powerful multi-role fighter. The first production models were the &apos;B&apos; two-seat trainer which lacked a radar and the &apos;C&apos; single seat interceptor/short range bomber. Despite the rather poor performance of the IIIC, the aircraft became very popular with air forces around the world. The most successful model by far was the IIIE with a larger fuselage and optimized as a long range fighter bomber. The Mirage III was such a successful concept that it has served as the basis for no less than six related designs--the Mirage IV nuclear bomber, the Mirage 5/50 attack fighters, the Mirage F.1 fighter, the Mirage 2000 fighter, Mirage 2000 bomber, the Israeli Kfir attack fighter, and the South African Cheetah attack fighter. All told, some 1,400 Mirage III, 5, and 50 aircraft were built.

The Mistral, a fire-and-forget missile equipped with a high technology infrared homing head, is fully autonomous after firing. Lightweight (18 kg), its speed, its guidance accuracy, its maneuverability and its laser proximity or impact fuse triggered 3 kg warhead ensure exceptional effectiveness against aircraft, helicopters and anti-ship missiles. More than 600 Mistral missiles have been fired under operational conditions with a success rate over 92%. Some 15,000 missiles have been ordered by eight European countries, eight in Asia-Pacific, four in South America and three in the Middle-East.
                     
The basic Mistral missile is used with a man-portable launch unit. There are also launch units that allow the missile to be fired from armoured vehicles, ships or helicopters (such as the Aérospatiale Gazelle, Denel Rooivalk, or Eurocopter Tiger). To reject the flares ejected from the rear of the targeted aircraft, proportional navigation using a gyro as a reference is adopted for Mistral, instead of the pursuit method in earlier IR-guided MANPADS. To further enhance the ECCM capability, the seeker of Mistral has a very narrow field of view to reject decoys and interference, but the seeker can tilt in the  range of +/- 38 degrees. On the launcher, the missile runs up the gyro in 2 seconds, and total reaction time is 5 seconds. The all-aspect two-color (24 and 35 µm) cooled IR-seeker of Mistral is developed by SAT, and the missile adopts both laser proximity and impact fuzes.

The MK-20 Rockeye is a free-fall, unguided cluster weapon designed to kill tanks and armored vehicles. The system consists of a clamshell dispenser, a mechanical MK-339 timed fuze, and 247 dual-purpose armor-piercing shaped-charge bomblets. The bomblet weighs 1.32 pounds and has a 0.4-pound shapedcharge warhead of high explosives, which produces up to 250,000 psi at the point of impact, allowing penetration of approximately 7.5 inches of armor. Rockeye is most efficiently used against area targets requiring penetration to kill. Fielded in 1968, the Rockeye dispenser is also used in the Gator airdelivered mine system. During Desert Storm US Marines used the weapon extensively, dropping 15,828 of the 27,987 total Rockeyes against armor, artillery, and antipersonnel targets. The remainder were dropped by Air Force (5,345) and Navy (6,814) aircraft.

Torpedoes are self-propelled guided projectiles that operate underwater and are designed to detonate on contact or in proximity to a target. They may be launched from submarines, surface ships, helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. They are also used as parts of other weapons; the Mark 46 torpedo becomes the warhead section of the ASROC (Anti-Submarine ROCket) and the Captor mine uses a submerged sensor platform that releases a torpedo when a hostile contact is detected. The three major torpedoes in the Navy inventory are the Mark 48 heavyweight torpedo, the Mark 46 lightweight and the Mark 50 advanced lightweight.

The MK-46 torpedo is designed to attack high performance submarines, and is presently identified as the NATO standard. The MK-46 torpedo is designed to be launched from surface combatant torpedo tubes, ASROC missiles and fixed and rotary wing aircraft. In 1989, a major upgrade program began to enhance the performance of the MK-46 Mod 5 in shallow water. Weapons incorporating these improvements are identified as Mod 5A and Mod 5A(S). The MK-46 Mod 5 torpedo is the backbone of the Navy&apos;s lightweight ASW torpedo inventory and is expected to remain in service until the year 2015. The MK 46 originated with the RETORC I (Research Torpedo Configuration I) program conducted by the US Naval Undersea Center (NUC) at Pasadena, CA.

A fire bomb is a thin skinned container of fuel gel designed for use against dug-in troops, supply installations, wooden structures, and land convoys. The MK 77 500-pound fire bomb is the only fire bomb now in service. Fire bombs rupture on impact and spread burning fuel gel on surrounding objects. MK 13 Mod 0 igniters are used to ignite the fuel gel mixture upon impact. The MK-77 is a napalm canister munition. The MK77 familiy is an evolution of the incendiary bombs M-47 and M-74, used during the conflict in Korea and the war in Vietnam. Napalm is an incendiary mixture of benzene, gasoline and polystyrene. The Marine Corps dropped all of the approximately 500 MK-77s used in the Gulf War. They were delivered primarily by the AV-8 Harriers from relatively low altitudes. MK-77s were used to ignite the Iraqis oil-filled fire trenches, which were part of barriers constructed in southern Kuwait. The containers of napalm bomber are very light and fabricated of aluminum, with a capacity for about 75 gallons of combustible gel. They lack stabilizing fins, and consequently acquire a tumbling motion on being dropped that contributes to the scattering of the combustible gel over a wide area. While the MK-77 is the only incendiary munition currently in active inventory, a variety of other incendiary devices were produced, including the M-47 Napalm bomb, the M-74 incendiary bomb, and white phosphorous and munitions manufacturing. Production of these devices continued during the Korean conflict, though various demilitarization and decontamination programs were initiated in the late 1950s. Munitions destroyed included M-47 Napalm-filled bombs and incendiary cluster bombs. Napalm is a mixture of benzene (21%), gasoline (33%), and polystyrene (46%). Benzene is a normal component of gasoline (about 2%).

The MK 80 series Low Drag General Purpose (LDGP) bombs are used in the majority of bombing operations where maximum blast and explosive effects are desired. LDGP bombs are designed to be aerodynamically streamlined. Their cases are relatively light and approximately 45 percent of their complete weight is explosive. General purpose bombs may use both nose and tail fuzes and conical or retarded tail fins.
          
These are general-purpose low-drag, high-explosive filled bombs. They can be used against personnel, moderately reinforced concrete, and light armor. Both fragmentation and blast effect are produced.

The MK-82 is a free-fall, nonguided general purpose [GP] 500-pound bomb. The bomb is usually equipped with the mechanical M904 (nose) and M905 (tail) fuzes or the radar-proximity FMU-113 airburst fuze. The MK 80 series Low Drag General Purpose (LDGP) bombs are used in the majority of bombing operations where maximum blast and explosive effects are desired. LDGP bombs are designed to be aerodynamically streamlined. Their cases are relatively light and approximately 45 percent of their complete weight is explosive. General purpose bombs may use both nose and tail fuzes and conical or retarded tail fins.
		      
The MK82 AIR is a 500 pound bomb modified with a BSU-49/B high drag tail assembly. The &quot;ballute&quot; air bag which deploys from the tail provides a high speed, low altitude delivery capability by quickly slowing the bomb and allowing the aircraft to escape the blast pattern. The tail assembly consists of a low-drag canister unit containing a ballute (combination balloon and parachute), and a release lanyard assembly that opens the canister releasing the ballute. The ballute assembly is made from high strength low porosity nylon fabric. When the bomb is released from the aircraft a lanyard unlatches the back cover which opens, releasing part of the nylon bag/retarder. Air turbulence at the rear of the bomb acts on that portion of the retarder, pulling the remainder out of the housing. Ram air inflation is accomplished through four air inlet ports toward the aft end of the ballute. The weapon can be delivered in the low-drag mode (canister remains closed after release) or in the high drag mode. The pilot may select either a high drag or low drag configuration depending on mission requirements.
                   
These are general-purpose low-drag high-explosive filled bombs. The bombs are painted olive drab and have a yellow band 76mm wide around the nose and tail or around the nose only. The bomb body is steel. The charging well plug and the nose and tail closure plugs are steel or plastic. The external thermal protection covering on the bombs is a copolymer elastomer thermosetting compound. Externally thermally protected bombs have an alligator skin covering, and are designed primarily for shipboard use. Internally thermally protected bombs are marked as such.
            
The bombs are painted olive drab and have a yellow band (76mm (3.00 inches) wide) around the nose and tail or around the nose only. Thermally insulated bombs have two yellow bands (each 76mm (3.00 inches) wide) around the nose. Yellow lettering is stenciled around the body near the nose. Die-stamped markings on the side of the body include the Mk and Mod, ordnance drawing number, and type and weight of the explosive charge. Thermally insulated bombs are stenciled THERMALLY PROTECTED after the bomb nomenclature.

The MK-83 is a free-fall, nonguided general purpose [GP] 1,000 pound bomb. The bomb can be fitted either with mechanial nose and tail fuzes or with a proximity fuze. During Desert Storm, this bomb was dropped mainly by Marine aircraft conducting close air support/battlefield air interdiction (CAS/BAl) missions. The MK 80 series Low Drag General Purpose (LDGP) bombs are used in the majority of bombing operations where maximum blast and explosive effects are desired. LDGP bombs are designed to be aerodynamically streamlined. Their cases are relatively light and approximately 45 percent of their complete weight is explosive. General purpose bombs may use both nose and tail fuzes and conical or retarded tail fins.
                
The MK-80 series was developed in the 1950s in response to the need for bombs producing less aerodynamic drag. All MK-80 series bombs are similar in construction. MK-80 series bombs are cylindrical in shape and are equipped with conical fins or retarders for external high-speed carriage. They are fitted for both nose and tail fuzes to ensure reliability and produce effects of blast, cratering, or fragmentation.
                
Some bombs are thermally protected for use on aircraft carriers. The thermally protected MK 80 series bomb was developed to increase the cookoff time and decrease the reaction of bombs when engulfed in a fuel fire. The MK 82 and MK 83 series LDGP bombs underwent a Product Improvement Initiative (PII) which entailed filling the bomb cases with a less sensitive explosive. When so filled the MK 82 and MK 83 bombs are redesignated BLU-111/B and BLU-110/B, respectively.

Mk-83 with BSU-85 Ballute Air Inflatable Retarder Fin.
The MK83 AIR is a 1,000 pound bomb modified with a BSU-85/B high drag tail assembly. The &quot;ballute&quot; air bag which deploys from the tail provides a high speed, low altitude delivery capability by quickly slowing the bomb and allowing the aircraft to escape the blast pattern. The tail assembly consists of a low-drag canister unit containing a ballute (combination balloon and parachute), and a release lanyard assembly that opens the canister releasing the ballute. The ballute assembly is made from high strength low porosity nylon fabric. When the bomb is released from the aircraft a lanyard unlatches the back cover which opens, releasing part of the nylon bag/retarder. Air turbulence at the rear of the bomb acts on that portion of the retarder, pulling the remainder out of the housing. Ram air inflation is accomplished through four air inlet ports toward the aft end of the ballute. The weapon can be delivered in the low-drag mode (canister remains closed after release) or in the high drag mode. The pilot may select either a high drag or low drag configuration depending on mission requirements.

Bombs are the workhorses of air-to-ground warfare. Bombs types can be divided into four categories: general purpose (GP), fragmentation, demolition and penetration.
                
In GP bombs, the explosive material accounts for about half the total weight, balancing blast and fragmentation effects. Blast damage is most effective against structures, machinery and vehicles. Against personnel, the blast effect is confined to a relatively short radius from the impact point (about 110 feet for a 2,000lb Mk-84). Mk-82s and Mk-84s are GP bombs.
                
Demolition bombs contain 65%-80% explosive material and use a thin casing, which maximizes blast effects at the expense of fragmentation and penetration. The BLU-109 Durandal is a demolition bomb.
                
Fragmentation bombs contain only 10%-20% explosive material. There are no fragmentation bombs currently in the U.S. inventory, although GP bombs provide adequate fragmentation effects. The maximum effective fragmentation radius of most bombs, regardless of size, is about 3,000 feet.
                
Penetration bombs are designed to penetrate and explode inside a hard target. These bombs use strong, heavy cases, tail fuzes and consist of 25%-35% shock-resistant explosive material. The BLU-109 is an example of a penetration bomb.
                
High-drag bombs use ballutes or pop-out fins to quickly decelerate the weapon. This braking action allows the releasing aircraft to gain more separation from the impact point of the bomb than would be possible with a slick. High-drag bombs are used for low altitude bomb runs against area targets. Because the high-drag device makes the flight path of the bomb less predictable, these bombs aren&apos;t good for precision or higher altitude bombing. The BSU-49, BSU-50 and BLU-107 are examples of high-drag bombs.
                
The MK-84 is a free-fall, nonguided GP 2,000-pound bomb. The MK 80 series Low Drag General Purpose (LDGP) bombs are used in the majority of bombing operations where maximum blast and explosive effects are desired. LDGP bombs are designed to be aerodynamically streamlined. Their cases are relatively light and approximately 45 percent of their complete weight is explosive. General purpose bombs may use both nose and tail fuzes and conical or retarded tail fins. Normal fuzes are the mechanical M904 (nose) and the M905 (tail). Most of the over 12,000 MK-84s expended during Desert Storm were dropped by Air Force F-15Es, F-16s and F-111Fs; less than 1,000 of the total were dropped by Marine Corps tactical aircraft.

The Exocet is built by MBDA, a European missile company. Development began in 1967 by Nord as a ship-launched weapon named the MM 38. A few years later Aerospatiale and Nord merged. The basic body design was based on the Nord AS30 air-to-ground tactical missile. The air-launched Exocet was developed in 1974 and entered service with the French Navy five years later.
                
The relatively compact missile is designed for attacking small- to medium-size warships (e.g., frigates, corvettes and destroyers), although multiple hits are effective against larger vessels, such as aircraft carriers. It is guided inertially in mid-flight and turns on active radar late in its flight to find and hit its target. As a countermeasure against air defence around the target, it maintains a very low altitude during ingress, staying one to two meters above the sea surface. Due to the effect of the radar horizon, this means that the target may not detect an incoming attack until the missile is only 6,000 m from impact. This leaves little time for reaction and stimulated the design of close-in weapon systems (CIWS).
                
Its rocket motor, which is fuelled by solid propellant, gives the Exocet a maximum range of 70 kilometres (43 mi; 38 nmi). It was replaced on the Block 3 MM40 ship-launched version of the missile with a solid-propellant booster and a turbojet sustainer motor which extends the range of the missile to more than 180 kilometres (110 mi; 97 nmi). The submarine-launched version places the missile inside a launch capsule.
                
The Exocet has been manufactured in versions including:
MM38 (surface-launched) deployed on warships. Range: 42 km. No longer produced (1970). A coast defence version known as &quot;Excalibur&quot; was developed in the United Kingdom and deployed in Gibraltar from 1985-1997.
AM38 (helicopter-launched tested only)
AM39 (air-launched) B2 Mod 2: deployed on 14 types of aircraft (combat jets, maritime patrol aircraft, helicopters). Range between 50 and 70 km, depending on the altitude and the speed of the launch aircraft.
SM39 (submarine-launched) B2 Mod 2: deployed on submarines. The missile is housed inside a watertight launched capsule (VSM or vhicule Sous marin), which is fired by the submarine&apos;s torpedo-launch tubes. On leaving the water, the capsule is ejected and the missile&apos;s motor is ignited. It then behaves like an MM40. The missile will be fired at depth, which makes it particularly suitable for discreet submarine operations.
MM40 (surface-launched) Block 1, Block 2 and Block 3: deployed on warships and in coastal batteries. Range: 72 km for the Block 2, in excess of 180 km for the Block3.

Modern day multirole combat aircraft undertake the tactical reconnaissance (RECCE) role using a podded reconnaissance solution that can be shared amongst the aircraft type it is designed for.
                
In that context, Terma has developed the F-16 Tactical Reconnaissance System (TRS) for the Royal Danish Air Force (RDAF). The system has been operational since 2006 at Fighter Wing Skrydstrup. It consists of Terma&apos;s F-16 centerline mounted Modular Reconnaissance Pod (MRP) equipped with an advanced RECCE suite as well as associated Ground Station and Integrated Logistic Support (ILS) equipment.
                
Successful update of Terma&apos;s Modular Reconnaissance Pod
Due to a recent update performed by Terma, the F-16 Modular Reconnaissance Pod (MRP) have been certified for increased operational airspeeds with simultaneous carriage of a targeting pod, so the F-16s can now perform RECCE, Close Air Support (CAS), and precision bombing in one and the same mission - greatly increasing the flexibility during missions.

The General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper (sometimes called Predator B) is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) capable of remotely controlled or autonomous flight operations developed by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI) primarily for the United States Air Force (USAF). The MQ-9 and other UAVs are referred to as Remotely Piloted Vehicles/Aircraft (RPV/RPA) by the USAF to indicate their human ground controllers.
         
The MQ-9 is the first hunter-killer UAV designed for long-endurance, high-altitude surveillance. In 2006, the thenChief of Staff of the United States Air Force General T. Michael Moseley said: &quot;We've moved from using UAVs primarily in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance roles before Operation Iraqi Freedom, to a true hunter-killer role with the Reaper."
         
The MQ-9 is a larger, heavier, and more capable aircraft than the earlier General Atomics MQ-1 Predator; it can be controlled by the same ground systems used to control MQ-1s. The Reaper has a 950-shaft-horsepower (712 kW) turboprop engine (compared to the Predator's 115 hp (86 kW) piston engine). The greater power allows the Reaper to carry 15 times more ordnance payload and cruise at about three times the speed of the MQ-1.The aircraft is monitored and controlled by aircrew in the Ground Control Station (GCS), including weapons employment.
        
In 2008, the New York Air National Guard 174th Attack Wing began the transition from F-16 piloted fighters to MQ-9A Reapers, becoming the first fighter unit to convert entirely to unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) use. In March 2011, the U.S. Air Force was training more pilots for advanced unmanned aerial vehicles than for any other single weapons system. The Reaper is also used by the United States Navy, the CIA, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, NASA, and the militaries of several other countries.
        
The USAF operated 195 MQ-9 Reapers as of September 2016, and plans to keep the MQ-9 in service into the 2030s.

The MT-55A is a tank-launched bridge based on a T-55A MBT hull. The MT-55A span is 18 meters long and can support loads up to 50 tons. The launcher has a gap measuring device and infrared equipment for bridge laying at night.
                
The MT-55A (Slovak: Mostn tank) is an armoured vehicle-launched bridge (AVLB) tank, manufactured by ZTS Martin in Slovakia. The AVLB is based on a T-55A medium tank chassis, with the turret detached and replaced by a special bridge launching equipment.
                
The MT-55A was produced for the armies of the Warsaw Pact (including the Soviet Army), as well as for export clients.
                
The MT-55A was designed and produced by ZTS Martin from 1962 (the former Czechoslovakia was one of the countries that build the T-54/55 series under licence). The development phase ended in 1967 after which five pre-series vehicles were built. Series production started in 1969.
                
The transformed T-55A chassis differs only by the arrangement of the compartments in the hull. The bridge tank is proposed for an easy and swift crossing of antitank barriers (trenches) and other obstacles with the purpose of facilitating the passage of mechanised and tank units.
                
The bridge initiating equipment is controlled by a system of hydraulic cylinders; the allocation of hydraulic oil can be controlled both manually by mechanical levers and automatically. The pressure of the liquid is provided by high-pressure piston pumps motorized by the tank engine. All mechanisms of the MT-55A used for laying and recovering the bridge can be controlled by the crew from inside the tank with the hatch covers closed.
                
To begin the launching process, the vehicle stops short of the gap; then, the bridge swings ahead and down while its two sections open like scissors. The MT-55A span is 18 meters long and can support loads of up to 50 tons. Later, the MT-55A was modified with a gap measuring mechanism and infrared equipment for bridge laying in darkness.
                
Total production of the MT-55A between 1969 and 1983 amounted to 1,762 vehicles, including 183 export versions MT-55KS (from 1971) and 301 hulls for East Germany&apos;s BLG-60 programme.

Under development as a V/STOL assault transport for the U.S. Marine Corps and under consideration for a host of other applications, this fascinating tilt-rotor hybrid rotary/fixed-wing transport offers an excellent combination of payload/range and VTOL capabilities in the manner of the concept validated by the success of the Bell Model 301 (XV-15) research type that flew in May 1977.
The Osprey is in some ways a typical tactical airlifter in its rectangular-section fuselage, upswept tail unit, high-set wing, and retractable tricycle landing gear with its twin-wheel main units retracting into lateral lower-fuselage sponsons that also accommodate a sizable proportion of the internal fuel capacity. The chief differences between the typical tactical airlifter and the Osprey, however, lie in the latter&apos;s propulsion/vertical lift system of a single large proprotor and its engine located at each wing tip. The proprotors, complete with their engines and associated nacelles, can be turned between the vertical position in which they deliver direct lift, and the horizontal position in which they deliver direct thrust, under command of the triplex digital fly-by-wire control system.
Six prototypes were ordered in May 1986, and the first of these flew in March 1989 before achieving its first full translation from helicopter to aeroplane mode in September 1989. It was planned that the type should enter service in the early 1990s, but the program has been delayed by a measure of service antipathy as well as technical problems. The Osprey resulted from an advanced JVX (Joint Services Vertical Lift Aircraft - Experimental) requirement of 1982, which included among its requirements a hovering ceiling of 3,000 ft (915 m) out of ground effect while carrying an external load of 8,300 lbs (3,765 kg), a radius of 200 nm (230 miles; 371 km) with 24 troops, and a ferry range of 2,100 nm (2,418 miles; 3,892 km) with auxiliary fuel tanks in the cabin.
The type is fitted with two external hooks able to carry 10,000 lbs (4,536 kg) individually or 15,000 lbs (6,804 kg) collectively, and also has a hold that is 24 ft 2 in (7.37 m) long, 5 ft 11 in (1.80 m) wide and 6 ft (1.83 m) high. This hold is fitted with a winch rated at 2,000 lbs (907 kg) and with removable roller rails for the handling of freight items, and is accessed by a hydraulically operated ventral ramp/door arrangement under the upswept tail unit.
        
The MV-22A was designed to supersede the Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight and Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion/Super Stallion assault helicopters, and plans called for the delivery of 552 aircraft from a time between December 1991 and April 1992, although the U.S. Department of Defense&apos;s 1989 review of financial commitments in the face of the U.S.A.&apos;s enormous budget deficit included among its proposals that there be a halt to further development of the Osprey in all its variants, the operating shortfall for the U.S. Marines being overcome by additional purchases of helicopters.
Later in 1989, the U.S. Congress restored the Osprey program to full status, but the 1990 survey of U.S. defense commitments in the light of the reduced Soviet bloc threat led to a renewed demand for cancellation that has since been translated into an extended final development program that may yet pave the way for a production model of which 425 are now required.
Among the host of other models that was originally planned were the CV-22A, HV-22A and SV-22A. The CV-22A was planned as the U.S. Air Force&apos;s special operations model (80 aircraft, later reduced to 55 and now to 50) with additional fuel and low-level flight capability provided by the Texas Instruments APQ-174 multi-mode and terrain-following radar. The specification included the ability to carry 12 troops or 2,880 lbs (1,306 kg) of internal freight over a radius of 520 nm (599 miles; 964 km), and to hover out of ground effect at 4,000 ft (1,220 m).
The HV-22A was planned as the U.S. Navy&apos;s combat SAR, special warfare and logistic support model (50 aircraft, now reduced to 48) based on the CV-22A. The specification included a crew of five, the ability to rescue four men at a radius of 460 nm (530 miles; 853 km), and the ability to hover at 3,000 ft (914 m) out of ground effect.
The SV-22A was proposed as the U.S. Navy&apos;s anti-submarine model (300 aircraft to replace the Lockheed S-3 Viking) with role-dedicated electronics and weapons.

Namer, means &quot;leopard&quot; and also a syllabic abbreviation of &quot;Nagmash&quot; (APC) and &quot;Merkava&quot; is an Israeli armored personnel carrier based on a Merkava tank chassis. Namer was developed by and is being assembled by the Israeli Ordnance Corps. It has entered service in limited numbers with the Israel Defense Forces since the end of 2008. However, as of 2014, still only very limited numbers of Namers were in service with the IDF. Due to budgetary constraints, the introduction of the Namer into the IDF has been slow, leaving the ground forces dependent on the M113 for many years to come.
                
They are more heavily armored than the Merkava IV tanks. According to the IDF, the Namer is the most heavily armored vehicle in the world of any type.

The NEWPORT class is a totally new concept for Tank Landing Ships (LSTs). The traditional bow doors of LSTs are missing. Instead, there is a bow ramp able to carry up to 40 tons for tanks to leave the ship. The hull is similar to that of an destroyer. These fundamental changes in design allow the NEWPORT class to operate at speeds of 20 knots, providing a high mobility.
                
Troop and equipment transport is the main role of the NEWPORt class. It has also been used for amphibious landing operations during the Gulf War and Operation Hope in Somalia. These Ships can carry 350 trops including their equipment.
                
Of the 20 build vessels, only two are in service. The others have been decommissioned into a reserve state, but can be recommissioned within a few days.
                
Vessels of the NEWPORT class are armed with 4 3inch .50cal Mk-33 guns, which are to be replaced with the Phalanx CIWS.

Project Nike was a US Army project, proposed in May 1945 by Bell Labs, to develop a line-of-sight anti-aircraft missile system. The project delivered America&apos;s first operational anti-aircraft missile system in 1953, the Nike Ajax. A huge number of the technologies and rocket systems used to develop the Nike Ajax were re-used in a number of roles, many of which gained the &quot;Nike&quot; name (after Nike, the goddess of victory from Greek mythology). The missile&apos;s first-stage solid rocket booster became the basis for everything from the Nike Hercules missile to NASA&apos;s Nike Smoke rocket, used for upper-atmosphere research.
                
For Nike, three radars were used. The acquisition radar searched for a target to be handed over to the Target Tracking Radar (TTR) for tracking. The Missile Tracking Radar (MTR) tracked the missile by way of a transponder, as the missile&apos;s radar signature alone was not sufficient. The MTR also commanded the missile by way of pulse-position modulation, the pulses were received, decoded and then amplified back for the MTR to track. Once the tracking radars were locked the system was able to work automatically following launch, barring any unexpected occurrences. The computer compared the two radars directions, along with information on the speeds and distances, to calculate the intercept point and steer the missile. The entirety of this system was provided by the Bell System&apos;s electronics firm, Western Electric.

The OE-349 Antenna Mast Group (AMG) is mounted on an M927 5-Ton Cargo Truck. It includes four 4 kW antennas in two pairs on remotely controlled masts. Emplacement of the AMG can have no greater than a 0.5-degree roll and a 10-degree crossroll.
                
The antennas can be controlled in azimuth, and the masts can be elevated up to 100 feet 11 inches (30.76 m) above ground level. Mounted at the base of each pair of antennas are two high-power amplifiers associated with the antennas and the radios in the collocated shelter.
                
It is through these antennas that the ECS and ICC send their respective UHF &quot;shots&quot; to create the PADIL network. The polarity of each shot can be changed by adjusting the &quot;feedhorn&quot; to a vertical or horizontal position.
This enables a greater chance of communication shots reaching their intended target when terrain obstacles may otherwise obscure the signal.

Russian OFAB series (blast-fragmentation general-purpose bombs)
The OFAB-100-120 is a small bomb can be carried on Sukhoi Su-17, Sukhoi Su-25, MiG-29, Su-27, Sukhoi Su-30 and various other aircraft.
                           
This bomb is designed to engage lightly armored materiel and military industrial facilities, as well as manpower. It is dropped from altitudes of 500 to 15,000 m at a speed of 500 to 1,150 km/h. This aircraft bomb is effective against personnel in open terrain and motorized infantry at the reserves concentration base either on the march or in battle array. It is filled with fragments and powerful explosive compositions based on TNT/RDX. The design of this aircraft bomb provides for better fragments distribution in the fragments flight area and high density of the fragmentation zone within the lethal range as compared to general-purpose munitions. Aircraft can carry this bomb with a single-point suspension bomb rack or on 14 NATO standard suspension systems, using the corresponding fuze type.

Russian OFAB series (blast-fragmentation general-purpose bombs)
OFAB 250-270. Fragmentation High Explosive Bomb 250-270 is intended for destruction of military-industrial sites, railway junctions, field facilities and personnel in open terrain as well as in light armored vehicles and trucks on the march or during attack within the main concentration perimeter.
           
The OFAB 250-270 has distinct features that are clearly different from the RBK series bombs. The OFAB 250-270 has a pair of tail rings, and the rear of the main part of the bomb does not extend to the end of the tail section. Another clear difference is the front of the OFAB 250-270, with a distinct ridge before the front of the bomb, a slight dome on the front, and a single large fuze.

While the Kiowa carries some offensive weaponry, it isn&apos;t much of a combat craft itself. Instead, it provides additional fire in support of true combat helicopters. Its primary role is to perform reconnaissance duties and to act as an observer for artillery units, thus guiding other units&apos; fire to their targets. Because of the support function of the OH-58D, the Kiowa is seldom alone except on recon missions. As a result, the threat to the Kiowa is minimal. Any aggressors will most likely concentrate on the aircraft that poses the greatest danger to them first.

Oil tankers move huge quantities of fuel, and are thus lucrative targets for any combatant trying to cut the enemy&apos;s supply lines.
         
An oil tanker, also known as a petroleum tanker, is a ship designed for the bulk transport of oil or its products. There are two basic types of oil tankers: crude tankers and product tankers. Crude tankers move large quantities of unrefined crude oil from its point of extraction to refineries. For example, moving crude oil from oil wells in a producing country to refineries in another country. Product tankers, generally much smaller, are designed to move refined products from refineries to points near consuming markets. For example, moving gasoline from refineries in Europe to consumer markets in Nigeria and other West African nations.
         
Oil tankers are often classified by their size as well as their occupation. The size classes range from inland or coastal tankers of a few thousand metric tons of deadweight (DWT) to the mammoth ultra large crude carriers (ULCCs) of 550,000 DWT. Tankers move approximately 2.0 billion metric tons (2.2 billion short tons) of oil every year.Second only to pipelines in terms of efficiency, the average cost of oil transport by tanker amounts to only US$5 to $8 per cubic metre ($0.02 to $0.03 per US gallon).
             
Some specialized types of oil tankers have evolved. One of these is the naval replenishment oiler, a tanker which can fuel a moving vessel. Combination ore-bulk-oil carriers and permanently moored floating storage units are two other variations on the standard oil tanker design. Oil tankers have been involved in a number of damaging and high-profile oil spills. As a result, they are subject to stringent design and operational regulations.

		<DescriptionData>
The Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate is a primary naval escort vessel for the U.S. Navy. Unlike other American escort vessels, the Perry is a comparatively inexpensive and non-specialized vessel. The low price was achieved by sacrificing a level of technology, such as equipping the ship with the SQS-56 sonar instead of a more effective system. Furthermore, the design of the vessel itself makes upgrade to some systems difficult. The result is that there are a large number of these ships in service. Despite the apparent limitations of this vessel and its high radar profile, it has nevertheless proven itself to be a valuable and reliable naval asset, partly because of the ability to accommodate two (Light Airborne Multipurpose System (LAMPS) helicopters on its rear hangar deck.

Fast attack craft like the OSA II are the result of the increasing reliance on surface-to-surface missiles and electronic sensors in naval combat. Although each OSA II carries only two anti-ship missiles, it only takes one hit to disable or destroy most larger ships. In addition, several small craft like the OSA II are more difficult to detect and destroy than a single, more powerful one, and can be built for the same price. The drawback to this strategy is that small craft cannot carry out extended blue water operations and are limited to coastal defense missions.

The Osumi class LST, is a Japanese amphibious transport dock. The class is also known as the Oosumi class. While the JMSDF describes the Osumi class as tank landing ships, they lack the bow doors and beaching capability traditionally associated with LSTs. Functionally, their well deck makes the Osumi class more like a dock landing ship (LSD).
                
As of 2014 there are 3 Osumi vessels active with the Japanese Maritime Self-Defence Force.

The OV-10 began life as the NA-300, a much-underestimated warplane designed for battlefield reconnaissance and counter-insurgency missions. The aircraft was an answer to the U.S. Marine Corps&apos;s Light Armed Reconnaissance Aircraft requirement. The OV-10 was later adopted by the U.S. Air Force.
North American designed the type with a central fuselage pod accommodating the crew and optional payload, a straight cantilever high-set wing with small ailerons and double-slotted flaps across virtually the full span of the trailing edges, twin booms supporting the two swept vertical surfaces and the high-set tailplane, and a retractable tricycle landing gear with a single wheel on each unit. Armament capability was provided by a major hardpoint under the fuselage together with lower-rated hardpoints under the stub wings that also carried the fixed machine gun armament, and provision was made at the wing tips for two AIM-9 Sidewinder short-range AAMs.
The U.S. Marine Corps preferred the NA-300 concept to the rival General Dynamics Model 48 Charger, and ordered seven YOV-10A prototypes. The first of these flew during July 1965 with a powerplant of two Garrett T76-G-6/8 turboprops, each rated at 600 shp (447 kW) and located in slim nacelles that were forward extensions of the tail booms under the wing, which spanned only 30 ft (9.14 m).
The YOV-10A was deemed generally satisfactory, and a production order was placed for the improved NA-305 version for service as the OV-10A, with span increased by 10 ft (3.05 m) and the powerplant uprated to two T76-G-10/12 (later T76-G- 416/417) turboprops.
By the early 1990s, the U.S.A.F.&apos;s force had been reduced to some 20 aircraft, some of the aircraft having been exported to Morocco and the Philippines and others earmarked for conversion to OV-10D standard as supplements to the U.S. Marine Corps&apos; force of this important variant.
The OV-10D designation covers 19 aircraft (including two YOV-10D service test machines and later increased in number by conversions) adapted from OV-10A standard for the U.S. Marine Corps&apos; Night Observation Surveillance (nocturnal surveillance and interdiction) role with more powerful IR-suppressed engines and provision for a more comprehensive armament (including laser-guided weapons) used in conjunction with the Texas Instruments AAS-37 Detecting, Ranging and Tracking System sensor package (FLIR, laser target designator and automatic TV tracker) located in a trainable turret under the lengthened nose and also used to provide target data for the General Electric M97 turret (one 20 mm General Electric M197 rotary three-barrel cannon and 1,500 rounds) that can be carried on the centerline hardpoint when the sponsons are omitted.

The 1S32 Pat Hand radar typically acquires the target at about 120 to 130 km and, when it is within 80 to 90 km, tracking can begin. The 1S32 Pat Hand combined a cluster of four antennas, the largest of which was a monopulse narrow beam target track antenna, to the left of which was the monopulse wide angle missile track antenna. Missile capture and command uplink antennas are mounted above the pair. An 9Sh33 optical tracker, identical to the 2K12 / SA-6 Gainful design, was later added. The `Pat Hand' can handle two missiles per target in order to increase kill probability. It has a maximum range of 128 km.
         
The 1S32 Pat Hand consists of a tracked armoured chassis GM-123 on top of which is mounted the radar system. The driver is seated at the front of the vehicle, on the left and has a single hatch cover in front of which are two periscope. The vehicle is motorized with a Model V-59 V-12 water-cooled diesel engine developing 520 hp. The 1S32 Pat Hand vehicle can run at a maximum speed of 35 km/h with a maximum cruising range of 780 km. 
         
The 2.44 m diameter `Pat Hand' radar is mounted on essentially the same chassis as the `Ganef' launcher with the whole assembly collapsed flat and a grille raised in front of the radar for road transit. The torsion bar suspension consists of seven dual rubber-tyre road wheels with the drive sprocket at the front and the idler at the rear, and four track-return rollers. Hydraulic shock absorbers are provided for the first and last road wheel stations. The vehicle has an air filtration and overpressure NBC system and an IR night vision system for the commander and driver but no amphibious capability.

The PGM-1 is outfitted with a semi-active laser (SAL), the PGM-2 with a TV seeker, and the PGM-3 with an imaging infrared (IIR) seeker. A PGM with a 500-pound warhead and an imaging infrared seeker, for example, would be designated PGM-500/3. The PGM-1/-2 went into production in 1990, and the PGM-3 in 1993. A PGM-4 program was terminated by the UK government in 1995.
        
PGM-1/2 missiles performed flight trials on the French Mirage 2000 combat aircraft and the U.S. F-16. In 1985, the UAE ordered 500 PGM-1s and 500 PGM-2s, first deploying the system on the Mirage 2000 airframe in 1992. After flight tests of the PGM-3s IIR seeker in October and November of 1995, the UAE ordered approximately 700 PGM-3s, bringing their total inventory to approximately 1,700 units.
          
The PGM-500/-2000 is a short-range, air-launched, air-to-surface missile. The PGM-500 is a shorter missile, measuring 3.38 m in length, 0.36 m in diameter, and weighing 404 kg at launch. The missile is powered by a single 127 mm MARC 223 solid fuel motor, and has a range of 15 to 50+ km, depending on launch altitude. The PGM-500 carries high explosive, blast fragmentation, or submunition warheads. All variants can be fitted with various fusing options, including impact or proximity/airburst detonations.
          
The PGM-2000 is longer and larger, measuring 4.62 m in length and 0.46 m in rear body diameter, but it is equipped with the same seekers and payloads as the PGM-500. Weighing 1115 kg at launch, the PGM-2000 is propelled by two 127 mm MARC 223 solid fuel motors.
        
The missile is fitted to the Mirage 2000, Panavia Tornado, SEPECAT Jaguar, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F/A-18 Hornet, and F-4 Phantom aircraft.

The PL-7 is a rear-aspect IR missile. It&apos;s probably a PRC clone of the French Magic-I by Matra. The seeker characteristics are similar to that of the AIM-9P seeker. Therefore, like the AIM-9P , the PL-7 is very susceptible against flares. The seeker has a larger FOV and gimbal limits than the AIM-9P. Likewise, maneuverability is higher than the AIM-9p, but not as high as for the AIM-9M. Overall, the PL-7&apos;s performance must be rated as midway between the two AIM-9 variants.
                
When defending against the PL-7, flares should usually work. However, when out of flares, the missile is difficult to evade because of the good maneuverability. Creating tracking problems for the incoming missile is the way to go.
                
The shooting pilot should strive to pull less than 5g when launching the missile to minimize initial tracking problems.

		<DescriptionData>
The PL-8 is a licensed copy of the Israeli Python-3 design. Developed in the 1980´s, it is carried by the Chinese J-7III. There are also two naval versions, the PL-8N and PL-8H.
                
The agile missile is powered by a high-impulse rocket motor. It´s maneuverability comes close to that of the AIM-9M, although it bleeds more speed at high g-maneuvers. The highly sensitive seeker has only limited IRCCM and is susceptible against flares and ground-clutter. Seeker tracking rate is comparable to the AIM-9M.
                
To spoof the missile force it to bleed energy by high-g turns and use flares. Due to the high speed of the PL-8 the target must react very quickly. When out of flares, the PL-8 can become quite dangerous. Generally, it is a good idea to handle every MiG-21 like a potential J-7III.
                
Except for the limited ground clutter rejection and sun reflections, the PL-8 can be shot much like the AIM-9M

		<DescriptionData>
The PL-10 is a short-range, infrared-homing air-to-air missile (AAM) developed by the People&apos;s Republic of China. It was designed by Dr. Liang Xiaogeng at the Luoyang Electro Optical Center, which is also known as Institute 612 and renamed in 2002 as the China Air-to-Air Guided Missile Research Institute. Development of the missile commenced in 2004 for use on stealth fighters such as the J-20.
                
The missile is fitted with a multi-element IIR seeker capable of +/-90 degree off boresight angles. The missile seeker can be slaved to a Helmet Mounted Display (HMD), allowing the pilot to track a target beyond the aircraft&apos;s radar scan envelope using the missile&apos;s high off-boresight capability, achieved by the pilot turning his head towards the target to lock-on, better known as &quot;look and shoot&quot;. Flight is controlled by a thrust-vector controlled solid rocket motor and free-moving type control wings on the missile&apos;s tail. The central portion of the missile has long, thin strakes, which help maintain missile maneuverability in the terminal homing stage after the rocket motor stops firing.
                
Externally the missile looks like the European IRIS-T air-to-air missile. The PL-10 was seen in 2015 integrated on the lateral weapons bay of the J-20 stealth fighter.

The PL-12 (Chinese: 'Thunderbolt-12') is an active radar-guided beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile developed by the People's Republic of China. It is considered comparable to the American AIM-120 AMRAAM and the Russian R-77.
                         
The first public information of the Leihua Electronic Technology Research Institute's PL-12 then called the SD-10  emerged in 2001. Development was assisted by Vympel NPO and Agat of Russia. Liang Xiaogeng is believed to have been the chief designer. Four successful test firings were made in 2004. By 2005, the missile was also known as the PL-12.
        
The PL-12 may use the radar and data link from the Russian R-77, or otherwise use systems benefiting from technology transfers from Russia. The missile uses a Chinese rocket motor and airframe. The PL-12 may have a passive homing mode for use against jammers and AEW aircraft.

The PL-15 ('Thunderbolt-15') is an active radar-guided very long range air-to-air missile developed by the People's Republic of China.
       
The PL-15 entered military service in 2016 and is carried by the Chengdu J-10C, Shenyang J-16 and the Chengdu J-20, aircraft.
        
The missile features an active electronically scanned array radar, and has a range exceeding 200 km, comparable to that of the Russian R-37 missile. It is 4 meters long and incorporates a dual-thrust rocket motor, capable of a speed of Mach 4.
            
Photos show that it has also been fitted to the newest version of the J-11B fighter upgraded with AESA radar.
        
A reported PL-15 missile with a range of over 400 km carried by a J-16 fighter may actually be the PL-21 missile.
         
Compared to the previous generation PL-12, the new and larger PL-15 has a longer radar detection range, increased anti-jamming capability and around twice the range. During the 2018 Airshow China, two J-20 fighters of the PLAAF displayed their internal payload bays, with each carrying four PL-15 and two PL-10E short-range missiles. The PL-15 effectively increases Chinese anti-access/area denial capability by targeting key &quot;enabler&quot; targets, such as aerial refueling and AEW aircraft.
      
Military expert Fu Qianshao suggested that China was developing an advanced long-range air-to-air missile capable of hitting targets at a distance of up to 400 km.

The PT-76 was the standard reconnaisance tank of the Warsaw Pact, before it was replaced by the BMP-1 and BMP M1976. It was also used as an troop carrier. Today it is still used in this role by some infantry or reconnaisance units.
                
Being widely in use (21 countries), there are various variants of the PT-76, which differ in details of the main 76mm gun. Apart from that, it served as a base for the chinese Type 60 and 63, and the BTR-50P amd OT-62 APCs. The launch and transport vehicles of the FROG-2 to FROG-5 and SA-6 use a modified PT-76 chassis.

PYTHON-3 is a third-generation short to medium range air-to-air missile adapted to the F-15, F-16, all types of Mirage, F-5, F-4 and Kfir C-2 and C-7 aircraft. The missile upgrades the capability of its carrier and gives it air superiority in modern air combat scenarios, such as:
Head-on interceptions
Beam interceptions
Dogfights involving high-g maneuvers
Low-altitude interceptions of helicopters and light aircraft
Self-defense air combat during penetration missions.
                
MAIN FEATURES
All-aspect capability, including head-on interception
Effective against most evasive tactics
Capable of intercepting low-signature and low-altitude threats
15 km maximum effective range at high altitude
Active proximity fuse, based on lead bias navigation system
Highly efficient warhead
Versatile target acquisition modes, including slaving to advanced radar system
Reliability greater than 95%
Full ILS, including combat doctrine manual, training and ground support equipment
                
The Python 3, RAFA&apos;EL&apos;s [Arms Development Authority] air-to-air missile, has intercepted dozens of Syrian planes. The pilot can launch the missile only after steering his plane at the enemy plane at a 30-40 degree cone.
                
The Python-3 is a much-improved AAM with all-aspect attack ability, higher speed, range, and performance. It performed well before and during the 1982 Lebanon War, scoring 35 (other sources claim 50) kills.
                
China&apos;s PLAAF was quite impressed with this missile, and paid for licensed production as the PL-8 AAM in the 1980s. The program code named &quot;Number 8 Project&quot; and formally started on September 15, 1983. From March 1988 to April 1989, technology transfer to China was complete while license assembly and license built parts continued, and by the spring of 1989, the complete domestic Chinese built missile received state certification. The major supplier of the missile was Xi&apos;an Eastern Machinery Factory located at Xi&apos;an, and China is also reported to have developed a helmet-mounted sight (HMS) system for the PL-8.

The Python 4 is a fourth generation WVR IR guided missile with unique aerodynamics for superior agility and a novel No-escape volume. It has an advanced homing head, with lateral squint capabilities to receive signals from a pilots line of sight with a special helmet.
                
Its reported that it can be launched as far as 15nm, and its effective 11kg warhead is electronically fused, making it one of the best in the world.
                
With all-aspect attack ability, and integration with a helmet-mounted sight (HMS) system. It entered service in the 1990s, and like its predecessor Python-3, it is integrated with the Elbit Systems DASH (Display And Sight Helmet) HMS system for Israeli F-15s and F-16s and Chilean F-16s (MLU and C/D block 50/52 plus) and F-5E/F Tiger III. The missile&apos;s seeker is reported to use dual band technology array similar to that of US FIM-92 Stinger (infrared and ultraviolet), with IRCCM (IR ECCM) ability to reduce background IR radiation to reduce the effectiveness of enemy flares.

Python-5 is a dual use missile suitable for air-to-air and surface-to-air missions. It integrates a fifth-generation imaging seeker, modern software, advanced infrared counter-countermeasure (IRCCM) and flight control systems.
                
The Python-5 is currently the most capable air-to-air missile in Israel&apos;s inventory and one of the most advanced AAMs in the world. As a beyond-visual-range missile, it is capable of &quot;lock-on after launch&quot; (LOAL), and has all-aspect/all-direction (including rearward) attack ability. The missile features an advanced electro-optical infrared homing seeker which scans the target area for hostile aircraft, then locks-on for terminal chase. With a total of eighteen control surfaces and careful design, the resulting missile is supposed to be as maneuverable as any other air-to-air missiles with thrust vectoring nozzles.  The Python-5 was first used in combat during the 2006 Lebanon War, when it was used by F-16 Fighting Falcons to destroy two Iranian-made Ababil UAVs used by the Hezbollah.
                
Python-5 is also provided in air defence configurations. The missile along with the Derby BVR missile is employed in the Spyder-SR/MR short and medium range mobile air defence systems. The missiles are installed with a booster assembly in the Spyder-MR configuration.
                
The Spyder-SR/MR system is capable of engaging a wide range of targets including attack helicopters, fighter aircraft, bombers, cruise missiles, UAVs and precision guided munitions. The system has 3600 engagement capability and can engage multiple aerial targets simultaneously.

Q-5 &quot;Fantan&quot;: First flown in June 1965, this is a drastic but basically conventional development of the Shenyang J-6 fighter - itself the Chinese-built version of the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19 &quot;Farmer&quot; - with slightly larger overall dimensions, a comparable powerplant and, to make the installation of a small weapons bay possible, a completely redesigned forward fuselage with the previous single nose inlet replaced by two lateral inlets.
The concept was originated by the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation in 1958, but was allocated to Nanchang for development. The program was canceled in 1961 but revived in 1963, and the first prototype flew in June 1965, allowing production to be authorized late in the same year. Considerable development had then to be undertaken and, after the first of two considerably altered prototypes had flown in October 1969, the Q-5 was authorized for production at the end of the same year for service deliveries from the following year.
The original Chinese scheme apparently had been to fit turbofan engines and nose radar when these became available, turning the Q-5 into an able medium-range tactical strike warplane with a 20 kiloton free-fall nuclear weapon carried in the weapons bay, but the type was then kept as a turbojet-powered conventional attack warplane and fighter-bomber. It has provisions for 2,205 lbs (1,000 kg) of disposable stores in the weapons bay, which is some 13 ft 1.5 in (4.00 m) long, and 2,205 lbs (1,000 kg) of disposable stores carried externally on two underfuselage and two underwing hardpoints.
The type has a powerplant of two Liming (LM) (previously Shenyang) Wopen-6 (Tumanskij R-9BF-811) turbojets, each rated at 7,165 lb st (31.87 kN) with afterburner, and has a brake chute accommodated in the tail cone between the upper and lower pen nib fairings.
Some aircraft were delivered to the Chinese naval air arm with Doppler radar in the nose and underfuselage provisions for two torpedoes or two C-801 anti-ship missiles.
Q-5 IA &quot;Fantan&quot;: This is an improved Q-5 I with two extra underwing hardpoints increasing disposable stores capability by 1,102 lbs/500 kg, a new gun/bomb sighting system, an RWR and a countermeasures system.
Q-5 II &quot;Fantan&quot;: This is a Q-5 I variant fitted or retrofitted with an RWR.
Although the Chinese are well satisfied with the Q-5 series in terms of flight performance and weapons carriage, they are less than happy with its electronics. In the second half of the 1980s, therefore, they contracted with two European consortia for the development of two sets of competing prototypes based on the Q-5 II, featuring radically improved electronics.
Any export version would be designated A-5M, and deliveries could have begun in the mid-1990s.
In 1992, it was revealed that China was planning, under the same designation, a revised version with a Martin-Baker zero/zero ejector seat, external load capability increased to 6,614 lbs (3,000 kg), an Alenia ECM pod, and a powerplant of two Xian Wopen-6A3 turbojet engines, which offered the same thrust ratings as the Wopen-6A but also doubled time between overhauls.
In other respects the Q-5M differs from the Q-5 IA in details such as its maximum disposable warload of up to 4,409 lbs (2,000 kg) carried on twelve hardpoints (two tandem pairs under the fuselage with each unit rated at 551 lbs/250 kg, and eight under the wings with each unit rated at 1,102 lbs/500 kg), electronics and operational equipment that includes two central computers, an air data computer, (fire control and weapons management), an Alenia HUD-35 with a FIAR P-2500 Pointer ranging radar input, an RWR, probably a South-West China Research Institute of Electronic Equipment KG8605 internal radar noise jammer, a China National Import and Export Corporation GT-1 chaff/flare dispenser, an IFF and a Litton LN-39A INS, a powerplant of two Liming Wopen-6A turbojets each rated at 6,614 lb st (29.42 kN) dry and 8,267 lb st (36.78 kN) with afterburner, greater external fuel capacity in the form of up to 2,597 lbs (1,178 kg) in two 301.2, 200.8 or 105.7 U.S. gal (250.75, 161.2 or 88 Imp gal; 1140, 760 or 400 liter) drop tanks, a length of 50 ft 5 in (15.336 m), a height of 14 ft 10.25 in (4.53 m), an empty weight of 14,833 lbs (6,728 kg), a normal take-off weight of 21,537 lbs (9,769 kg), a maximum take-off weight of 26,869 lbs (12,200 kg), a maximum clean level speed of 658 kts (758 mph; 1220 km/h) at sea level, a ferry range of 1,080 nm (1,243 miles; 2,000 km) with drop tanks, a radius of 280 nm (322 miles; 518 km) on a hi-lo-hi attack mission with maximum warload or 174 nm (200 miles; 322 km) on a lo-lo-lo attack mission with maximum warload, a maximum rate of climb at sea level of 22,638 ft (6,900 m) per minute, and a service ceiling of 52,500 ft (16,000 m).
Q-5K &quot;Fantan&quot;: With prototype trials starting in September 1988, the Q-5K is a version produced under the joint Chinese and French agreement signed in 1987 to provide an alternative to the Q-5M. The electronics are the responsibility of Thomson-CSF and include a Thomson-CSF HUD, a Thomson-CSF laser ranger, a Sagem INS, a TRT radar altimeter, a Crouzet air-data system, new instrumentation and a video camera. Any export version, now thought to be extremely unlikely, would be designated A-5K5.

Qaher means &quot;Conqueror&quot;
Even in the worst movie they wouldn&apos;t have dared!

Well, that&apos;s not quite true because there is still &quot;FIREFOX&quot; with Clint Easwood in 1982.

Comme il n&apos;ya pas grand chose dire sur le Q-313, il est le synopsis du film Firefox:

A joint Anglo-American plot is devised to steal a highly advanced Soviet fighter aircraft (MiG-31, NATO code name &quot;Firefox&quot;) which is capable of Mach 6, is invisible to radar, and carries weapons controlled by thought. Former United States Air Force Major Mitchell Gant (Clint Eastwood), a Vietnam veteran and former POW, infiltrates the Soviet Union, aided by his ability to speak Russian (due to his having had a Russian mother) and a network of Jewish dissidents and sympathizers, three of whom are key scientists working on the fighter itself. His goal is to steal the Firefox and fly it back to friendly territory for analysis.

However, the KGB has got wind of the operation and is already hot on Gant&apos;s tail. It is only through the sympathizers that Gant remains one step ahead of the KGB and reaches the air base at Bilyarsk, where the Firefox prototype is under heavy guard. The dissident scientists working on the Firefox help Gant infiltrate the base. Dr. Pyotr Baranovich (Nigel Hawthorne), one of the scientists, informs Gant that there is a second prototype in the hangar that must be destroyed. The diversion will allow Gant to enter the hangar and escape with the first Firefox. Gant knocks out Lt. Colonel Yuri Voskov (Kai Wulff), a Soviet pilot assigned to take the first prototype on its maiden flight during a visit from the Soviet First Secretary. The scientists attempt the destruction of the second prototype to give Gant time to suit up and start the first fighter, but the second prototype is not destroyed, and the scientists are killed by the guards. Fortunately for Gant, he escapes the hangar and lifts off just as the First Secretary arrives.

Evading the Soviets&apos; attempts to stop him, Gant barely reaches the Arctic ice pack and lands for refueling, making a rendezvous with a US submarine whose crew refuels and rearms the aircraft. However, Gant&apos;s last-minute refusal to kill Voskov has consequences; the Soviet pilot flies the second prototype, with orders to wait for him at the North Cape area. Gant completes the rendezvous and is on the way home when Voskov engages him in a dogfight. After a long battle, Gant barely manages to fire one of his rearward missiles and Voskov&apos;s plane is destroyed. Satisfied that there are no other Soviet forces chasing him, Gant begins his flight to safety.

The Super 530D retains the same general aerodynamic features and internal layout as its Super 530F predecessor, with cruciform low aspect ratio wings and cruciform aft controls. However, the stainless steel body is longer to accommodate a new radome, seeker assembly and a new and more powerful dual-thrust solid propellant motor.
                
Guidance is by the mono-pulse AD26 CW Doppler semi-active seeker, which has improved ECCM capability, and improved capability against low-flying targets. The missile&apos;s guidance unit is also fitted with digital micro-processing, which enables the seeker to be reprogrammed against new threats.
                
The R530 has four delta wings , with four triangular control surfaces at the rear. The R530 is 3.28 m long with a diameter of 263 mm , a wingspan of 1.1 m and a launch mass of 195 kg . The missile can receive two types of interchangeable search head, a semi-active guided version and an infrared-guided version. Both versions are equipped with a 27 kg high-explosive fragmentation charge.
                
Although often presented as a development of the R530, the Super 530F has little resemblance to its predecessor. It has a ceramic ogival radome sheltering the antenna of the researcher head AD26 and the guidance system. Behind this is the detonator, the military load, the security and arming module and the rocket engine. Grouped around the engine are the gyroscopes , the battery, the electric generator and the cylinders of the control surfaces. The missile is equipped with cross-shaped steel honeycomb wings, which gives it lift and smoothes the airflow for control surfaces. The Super 530 F is 3.54 m long with a diameter of 263 mm and a span of 0.88 m . Its launch mass is 245 kg . It is equipped with a 30 kg fragmentation and high explosive warhead that gives it a dead zone of about 20 m . It is guided by a semi-active research head AD26. The missile is directed by the radar wave emitted by the launcher plane which is reflected by its target. The propulsion is carried out by a solid fuel engine manufactured by SNPE , which accelerates the missile up to a speed of the order of Mach 4.5 . The Super 530 F is described as having a maximum range of 25 km , an intercept altitude of 23,000 m and an ascent capacity of 9,000 m .
                
The Super 530 D recovers the same general aerodynamic properties and the same internal layout as its predecessor the Super 530 F, with its cruciform empennage at the rear. However, its stainless steel body is longer to accommodate a new radome and a new research head. It also has a more powerful engine. The Super 530 D is 3.8 m long with a diameter of 263 mm and a wingspan of 0.62 m ; its launch mass is 270 kg and has the same military load as the Super 530 F. It is guided by a semi-active AD26 Doppler radar-guided homing head equipped with electronic countermeasure capabilities ( ECCM) and against improved low-flying aircraft. The operating potential of the homing device was limited to 25 hours, its continued use during non-firing patrols was not originally planned, but was increased to 200 hours after testing 5 . The guidance unit of the Super 530 D is also equipped with digital microprocessors, which can be reprogrammed in the face of new threats. The Super 530 D has a maximum intercept altitude of 24,400 m . Its climbing ability is 12,200 m and can intercept a target at a minimum altitude of 60 m . The maximum speed of the missile is close to Mach 5 and its range of action is 40 km . Combined with the Cyrano IV radar, he is able to fetch a hostile target flying at Mach 3 at 18,300 meters with a vertical drop of more than 3,050 meters compared to the interceptor.

It is an upgraded version from the Magic I, the &quot;Magic 2&quot;, replaced the original model in 1986. 11,300 Magic 2 were produced; it was exported, notably to Iraq and Greece, who used it in combat.
                
The Magic 2 replaced the AD3601 seeking head with the AD3633 giving it all aspect capability. The Magic 2 has an opaque dome on its nose.
                
For the sake of economy, a training version, equipped only with the homing device was created because the missile wears in flight. To change a tube equipped with a homing device is cheaper than a complete missile, equipped in addition with explosive charge, proximity rocket and thruster and system of fins.
                
The models of Magic, devoid of homing, are orange.
                
The inert Magic I missiles were blue and had all their wings. Now they are blue or gray and just have cruciform tail stumps.
                
The Magic &quot;War Bonds&quot; are light gray, and have a yellow stripe and a brown. A dark gray area on the body indicates the area of ??the military charge.

The R.550 Magic (Acronym for Missile Auto-Guid Interception et Combat) is a short-range air-to-air missile designed in 1968 by French company Matra to compete with the American AIM-9 Sidewinder.
                
The largest single competitor for the Sidewinder in Western Europe, the Matra Magic R.550 had better design and performance requirements than the AIM-9H/ J from the 1970&apos;s. It can be fired at any speed (no minimum), meaning that it is a prime candidate for the arming of attack helicopters. Magic is slightly larger in diameter than the Sidewinder, but the launch installation components in the carrying aircraft were wisely made interchangeable. The tail fins of the R.550 are free to rotate around the rocket&apos;s nozzle, providing of spin-stabilization.
                
On 11 January 1972, a Gloster Meteor of the centre for in-flight trials fired the R550 Magic and shot down a Nord CT20 target drone (unmanned aerial vehicle).
                
Mass-produced from 1976, the Magic was adopted by the French Air Force and the Navy.
                
The Argentine Air Force received &quot;Magic 1&quot; for its Mirage IIIEA during the 1982 Falklands War.
                
The Argentine Navy received &quot;Magic 1&quot; for its Super Etendards after the 1982 Falklands War.

The Dassault Rafale, literally meaning &quot;gust of wind&quot;, and &quot;burst of fire&quot; in a more military sense) is a French twin-engine, canard delta wing, multirole fighter aircraft designed and built by Dassault Aviation. Equipped with a wide range of weapons, the Rafale is intended to perform air supremacy, interdiction, aerial reconnaissance, ground support, in-depth strike, anti-ship strike and nuclear deterrence missions. The Rafale is referred to as an &quot;omnirole&quot; aircraft by Dassault.
                
In the late 1970s, the French Air Force and Navy were seeking to replace and consolidate their current fleets of aircraft. In order to reduce development costs and boost prospective sales, France entered into an arrangement with UK, Germany, Italy and Spain to produce an agile multi-purpose fighter, the Eurofighter Typhoon. Subsequent disagreements over workshare and differing requirements led to France&apos;s pursuit of its own development program. Dassault built a technology demonstrator which first flew in July 1986 as part of an eight-year flight-test programme, paving the way for the go-ahead of the project. The Rafale is distinct from other European fighters of its era in that it is almost entirely built by one country, involving most of France&apos;s major defence contractors, such as Dassault, Thales and Safran.
                
Many of the aircraft&apos;s avionics and features, such as direct voice input, the RBE2 AA active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar and the optronique secteur frontal infra-red search and track (IRST) sensor, were domestically developed and produced for the Rafale programme. Originally scheduled to enter service in 1996, the Rafale suffered significant delays due to post-Cold War budget cuts and changes in priorities. The aircraft is available in three main variants: Rafale C single-seat land-based version, Rafale B twin-seat land-based version, and Rafale M single-seat carrier-based version.
                
Introduced in 2001, the Rafale is being produced for both the French Air Force and for carrier-based operations in the French Navy. The Rafale has been marketed for export to several countries, and it has been selected for purchase by the Indian Air Force, the Egyptian Air Force, and the Qatar Air Force. The Rafale has been used in combat over Afghanistan, Libya, Mali, Iraq and Syria. Several upgrades to the weapons and avionics of the Rafale are planned to be introduced by 2018.

The designations RBK-250 and RBK-500 are the transliteration of the Cyrillic (Soviet) designations. These are air launched, high drag, freefall nose ejection clusters which employ a mechanical time tail fuze. The clusters may be loaded with fragmentation, antitank, incendiary, or toxic chemical bombs.
                      
The clusters are painted olive drab or gray. Markings on the olive drab clusters are black. Markings on the gray clusters are black and white. The designation of the bombs contained in the cluster is stenciled on the front half of the cluster.
        
RBK-250 = 48 ZAB 2.5 Incendiary
RBK 250-275 = 60 AO-2.5 APAM
RBK 250-275 = 150 AO-1SCh bomblet (4800sqm cover area)

		<DescriptionData>
Given the excellent payload/range performance of the KC-135A Stratotanker and C-135 Stratolifter series, it was natural that the type should be developed for a number of other applications including operational and strategic reconnaissance in the form of the arcane science of ELINT. Boeing assigned this series a different company designation, Model 739, to indicate its considerable difference from the Model 717 derivatives in their electronics rather than in the basic airframe/powerplant combination. The first such variants were several KC-135A tankers modified with electronic recording equipment in the early 1960s for use in the &quot;Iron Lung&quot; and &quot;Briar Patch&quot; programs. At the same time, several KC-135A-II and at least five JKC-135A conversions were designated to monitor Soviet ICBM test launches in the &quot;Office Boy&quot; and &quot;Nancy Rae&quot; programs. The first variant built specifically for the reconnaissance role was the RC-135A photo-mapping and electronic reconnaissance type, which was based on the C-135A and using the same J57-P-59W engines. Four such aircraft were delivered in 1965 and 1966 with a fuel dump tube in the place occupied by the in-flight refueling boom in the KC-135A, one forward fuselage tank removed, geodetic survey equipment installed internally, and a camera package located in a bay aft of the landing gear&apos;s nose unit. This last incorporated a sliding panel over the large, flat glass plate that was optically ground to provide the multiple cameras with optimum viewing conditions. The aircraft were later converted into KC-135D tankers.
Ten of these aircraft were built with the designation RC-135B for the electronic reconnaissance role, and were based structurally on the C-135B transport but equipped with Pratt &amp; Whitney TF33-P-9 rather than TF33-P-5 turbofans. The aircraft were completed in 1964 and 1965, and before delivery were converted by Martin into RC-135Cs for a variety of electronic reconnaissance tasks without any standardization in the electronic fit, which was optimized for the SIGINT task with the ASD-1 automatic reconnaissance system and the QRC-259 fast-sweep analyzer as the core units.

Ship launched verison of the AGM-84A Harpoon anti-ship missile. Entered service in 1977, see AGM-84A.
                
The Harpoon is the only dedicated anti-ship missile in service with U.S. armed forces. It has been developed into several advanced versions, including the SLAM (Stand-off Land Attack Missile) derivatives for high-precision attacks on land targets. The Harpoon and SLAM will remain in service with the U.S. Navy for the foreseeable future.
                
In 1965 the U.S. Navy began studies for a missile in the 45 km (25 nm) range class for use against surfaced submarines. The name Harpoon was assigned to the project (i.e. a harpoon to kill &quot;whales&quot;, a naval slang term for submarines). After the sinking of the Isreali destroyer Eilat in 1967 by Soviet-built antiship missiles, the U.S. Navy saw the need to develop a dedicated anti-shipping missile, and therefore Harpoon&apos;s primary mission became surface ship attack. The development project was formally begun in 1968, and the missile designator ZAGM-84A was allocated in 1970 after the Navy had issued a formal RFP (Request For Proposals). In June 1971, McDonnell-Douglas was awarded the prime contract for Harpoon, and the first test missile flew in October 1972. By that time it had already been decided to develop airlaunched, ship-launched and submarine-launched Harpoon variants, designated AGM-84A, RGM-84A and UGM-84A, respectively. Because the range requirement was increased to 90 km (50 nm), turbojet propulsion was selected by McDonnell-Douglas. Production of the Harpoon began in 1975, and the first version to enter service was the shipborne RGM-84A in 1977, followed by the AGM-84A on P-3 aircraft in 1979. The UGM-84A became operational on attack submarines in 1981. There are also unarmed training versions of the AGM/RGM/UGM-84A, designated ATM-84A, RTM-84A and UTM-84A.

Originally developed in the 1950s as the harbinger of a new era in air-to-air combat in which fighter aircraft would use radar and missiles to destroy targets without ever getting close enough to see them, the AIM-7 Sparrow&apos;s performance in real combat was disappointing at best. The failure of Beyond Visual Range (BVR) combat in the Vietnam War sent both U.S. Air Force and Navy fliers back to the drawing boards in search of better tactics and better training. Even as late as 1989, the missile&apos;s performance has been underwhelming; out of eight missiles fired in various engagements during the 1980s, only two hit their targets. Modern versions of the missile share little more than the name and air frame with its Vietnam-era brethren, and performed somewhat better during Operation Desert Storm. Out of 88 Sparrow missiles fired in the Gulf War, 23 destroyed their targets, representing 70% of Coalition aerial victories. The reasons for the improved performance are thought to be better U.S. pilot training, new solid-state electronics and the abysmal performance of Iraqi pilots (the Sparrow has always done well against non-maneuvering targets).
                
Engagement Sequence
The Sparrow operates by semi-active radar homing. The missile can home on both pulse-Doppler and continuous wave radar signals, enabling it to be fired by most radar equipped U.S. warplanes. Reliability aside, the main tactical weakness of the Sparrow is that the launching fighter must maintain a lock until the missile hits its target. This requirement allows the missile to be defeated by a turn into the beam and can force the attacker into an undesirable situation since his maneuvers are constrained while he maintains a lock.
                
RIM-7 NATO Sea Sparrow
The RIM-7 is the naval variant of the AIM-7 Sparrow. It is used by many US and NATO ships as surface-to-air missile. There are various variants of the Sea Sparrow to accommodate for different launcher systems.

SM-2 (Standard Missile 2) was developed as the missile component of the U.S. Navy&apos;s Aegis fleet air defense system. The SM-2 missile uses semi-active radar homing only in the terminal intercept phase, and has a new inertial guidance unit and a new programmable MK 2 autopilot to guide it near the projected point of intercept. On Aegis ships, this autopilot is command-guided to the target by the launching ship, which can track multiple targets with the Aegis&apos; powerful AN/SPY-1 radar (current version is AN/SPY-1D). When used on earlier Tartar ships, SM-2 uses pre-launch settings and its inertial guidance system to find its way to the target. Not needing SAR guidance through all its flight-path, effective intercept range of the SM-2MR is 60 percent greater than for the SM-1MR. The command guidance allows a more energy-efficient flight path, and the illuminator radar (e.g. AN/SPG-62) can provide effective illumination at almost doubled target ranges (because illumination immediately after launch is especially power-demanding, when the radar beam has to travel all the distance from ship to target and back). A further improvement in the SM-2 is the new monopulse seeker for terminal homing, which provides better ECM resistance.
                
The RIM-66C designation applied to SM-2MR Block I missiles for Aegis ships. It had a MK 115 blastfragmentation warhead. RIM-66C entered service in 1978 and was produced until 1983. RIM-66D is the SM-2MR missile for Tartar ships.
                
All Standard missiles had inherent surface-to-surface capability. But there were also versions designed specifically as ship-to-ship weapons. The RGM-66D SSM-ARM (Surface-to-Surface Missile/Anti- Radiation Missile) was a relatively simple development of the RIM-66B SM-1MR Block V, which used an anti-radiation seeker to home on enemy ship radars. The designation RTM-66D was applied to a training version of the RGM-66D. The RGM-66E was a version of the SSM-ARM for use with the ASROC launcher. The RGM-66F was a projected active radar homing anti-ship missile. It was to have a monopulse doppler radar, which was briefly tested in 1973, but the RGM-66F was cancelled in 1975. SM-2MR Block II introduced an improved Thiokol MK 104 rocket motor, to deal with faster and more manoeuverable targets. The effective range is almost doubled, reaching the limits of illuminator power. Block II also has a new high-velocity fragmentation warhead. The RIM-66G is the Aegis version, RIM-66H is for vertical launch on Aegis ships with MK 41 VLS (Vertical Launch System), and RIM-66J is for Tartar ships. SM-2MR Block II entered service in 1983.

The RIM-162 Evolved SeaSparrow Missile (ESSM) is a development of the RIM-7 Sea Sparrow missile used to protect ships from attacking missiles and aircraft.ESSM is designed to counter supersonic maneuvering anti-ship missiles. ESSM also has the ability to be &quot;quad-packed&quot; in the Mark 41 Vertical Launch System, allowing up to four ESSMs to be carried in a single cell.
         
The original Sea Sparrow was an expedient design intended to provide short-range defensive fire in a system that could be deployed as rapidly as possible. In the years after its introduction, it was upgraded to follow improvements being made in the air-to-air models used by the US Navy and US Air Force. The ultimate version in this line of weapons was the R model, which introduced a new dual-seeker homing system and many other upgrades. However, the AIM-120 AMRAAM offered higher performance from a missile that was smaller and lighter, and development of the Sparrow ended in the 1990s. This left only the Sea Sparrow using the basic platform, and it no longer had to fit on aircraft. So instead of simply using the P and R models as they were, it was decided to dramatically upgrade the weapon. The ESSM emerged as a completely new weapon, common only in name with the original, although using all of the same support equipment allowing it to be fit to ships already mounting the older models. Compared to the Sea Sparrow, ESSM has a larger, more powerful rocket motor for increased range and agility, as well as upgraded aerodynamics using strakes and skid-to-turn. In addition, ESSM takes advantage of the latest missile guidance technology, with different versions for Aegis/AN/SPY-1, Sewaco/Active Phased Array Radar (APAR), and traditional target illumination all-the-way.
         
In the 2000s the NATO Seasparrow Project Office began planning an upgraded Block 2 version of the ESSM. In 2014 Canada pledged 200M CAD to underwrite their share of the Block 2's development cost. ESSM Block 2 leverages the existing Block 1 rocket motor and features a dual-mode X band seeker, increased maneuverability, and other enhancements. Block 2 features enhanced communications systems that allow for mid-course guidance correction, which makes the missiles easily networked into the Navy's emerging Cooperative Engagement Capability. Unlike Block 1, Block 2's active radar homing seeker will support terminal engagement without the launch ship's target illumination radars. The improved ESSM Block II will be fielded by the US Navy from 2020.

The S-8 is a rocket weapon developed by the Soviet Air Force for use by military aircraft. It remains in service with the Russian Air Force and various export customers.
      
Developed in the 1970s, the S-8 is an 80 mm (3.1 in) rocket used by fighter bombers and helicopters. The system entered service in 1984 and is produced in a variety of subtypes with different warheads, including HEAT anti-armor, high-explosive fragmentation, smoke, and incendiary, as well as the specialized S-8BM runway-destroying munition and the S-8DM fuel-air explosive variants. Each rocket is between 1.5 meters (4 ft 11 in) and 1.7 meters (5 ft 7 in) long and weighs between 11.3 kg (25 lb) and 15.2 kg (33.5 lb), depending on warhead and fuse. Range is 2 to 4 kilometers (1.3 to 2.6 mi).
      
The S-8 is generally carried in the B series of rocket pods, carrying either seven or 20 rockets.
      
In 2018, the Russian Aerospace Forces took delivery and completed state tests of several batches of the S-8OFP Broneboishchik, successor to the S-8. While both rockets are unguided, the S-8OFP has greater range, a heavier warhead, and a digital fuse. The rocket is intended for armament of Su-25 type aircraft and Mi-8 helicopters, depending on the settings of the fuse, is able to penetrate obstacles facing the set targets, it can also explode in front of the obstacle and behind the obstacle.
      
An armored self-propelled 80-tube MLRS vehicle using S-8 rockets has been developed by Belorussian industry. Relatively short range of the rocket (3 - 5km cross-ground) compared to Grad rockets is compensated for by lower cost and greater beaten area from a high number of rockets.

The S-13 rocket was developed in the 1970s to meet requirements for a penetrating weapon capable of cratering runways and penetrating hardened aircraft shelters, bunkers and pillboxes, to fill a gap between 80 mm and 240 mm rockets and fulfill a role similar to the 127 mm Zuni rocket. The S-13 is conventional in layout, with a solid rocket motor and folding tail fins that provide stability after launch.
        
The first trials were in 1973, but it was introduced only in 1983. S-13 rockets are shot from 5-tube launchers B-13L, that can be carried by most of Soviet and Russian attack and new fighter aircraft, like Sukhoi Su-17/20/22, Sukhoi Su-24, Sukhoi Su-25, Sukhoi Su-27, MiG-23BN, MiG-27, MiG-29. B-13L1 launcher is used by helicopters such as Mil Mi-24, Mil Mi-28, Kamov Ka-29TB, Kamov Ka-50 and Kamov Ka-52.

The S-60 is a towed single barrel anti-aircraft gun for use against low flying aircraft. It can also be employed in ground to ground role against armored vehicles. The S-60 is optically guided. However, it can be used in conjunction with the PUAZO-6/60 director and the SON-9 or SON-9A (Fire Can) radars. Additionally, the FLAP WHEEL fire control can be used by the S-60. In all cases, non-optical guidance equipment is off-carriage.
                
Being non self-propelled, the S-60 is normally towed by the Ural-375 truck (Soviet army). This is one of the S-60 biggest disadvantages - it&apos;s lack of mobility - and one of the reasons that it is replaced by modern guns and SAM systems.
                
The Chinese have licensed the S-60 and build it under the designation of Type-59. A twin version of the S-60 is known as the S-68.

The V-750 is a two-stage missile consisting of a solid-fuel booster and a storable liquid-fuel upper stage, which burns red fuming nitric acid as the oxidizer and kerosene as the fuel. The booster fires for about 45 seconds and the main engine for about 22 seconds, by which time the missile is traveling at about Mach 3. The booster mounts four large, cropped-delta wing fins that have small control surfaces in their trailing edges to control roll. The upper stage has smaller cropped-deltas near the middle of the airframe, with a smaller set of control surfaces at the extreme rear and (in most models) much smaller fins on the nose.
          
The missiles are guided using radio control signals (sent on one of three channels) from the guidance computers at the site. The earlier S-75 models received their commands via two sets of four small antennas in front of the forward fins while the D model and later models used four much larger strip antennas running between the forward and middle fins. The guidance system at an S-75 site can handle only one target at a time, but it can direct three missiles against it. Additional missiles could be fired against the same target after one or more missiles of the first salvo had completed their run, freeing the radio channel.
         
The missile typically mounts a 195 kg (430 lb) fragmentation warhead, with proximity, contact, and command fusing. The warhead has a lethal radius of about 65 m (213 ft) at lower altitudes, but at higher altitudes the thinner atmosphere allows for a wider radius of up to 250 m (820 ft). The missile itself is accurate to about 75 m (246 ft), which explains why two were typically fired in a salvo. One version, the SA-2E, mounted a 295 kg (650 lb) nuclear warhead of an estimated 15 kiloton yield or a conventional warhead of similar weight.
       
Typical range for the missile is about 45 km (28 mi), with a maximum altitude around 20,000 m (66,000 ft). The radar and guidance system imposed a fairly long short-range cutoff of about 500 to 1,000 m (1,600 to 3,300 ft), making them fairly safe for engagements at low level.

While the aging SA-2 is considered mobile, at more than 100 tons it just barely qualifies. The system must be divided into separate sections for transport before being reassembled at its destination. Despite its age, the Guideline is still moderately effective due to the extensive combat experience and subsequent upgrades it has received. The large, single missile launched by this system is easily capable of destroying almost any aircraft; the missiles can also be equipped with nuclear warheads.

The SA-3 is normally mounted in pairs on trucks or tracked vehicles (some variants mount four). These missiles can be launched directly from the vehicles they are mounted on, cutting setup time to a bare minimum. Like the SA-2, these missiles first appeared in the 1950s and are equally outdated. However, they still pose a significant threat, particularly when used in conjunction with other anti-aircraft weaponry.

The missiles are launched with the aid of four solid fuel rocket motors inside boosters attached to the outside of the missile. Once they have burned and the missile is aloft, a liquid-fuelled ramjet sustainer engine is ignited. It reaches speeds of up to Mach 4 and has an effective range of 5055 km (3134 miles) depending upon the version. It carries a 135 kg (300 lb) fragmentation warhead. Possible engagement altitudes range from 100 m to 27 km (330-88,500 feet). The 3M8 missile was designed and produced by NPO Novator.
          
Optical tracking is possible for guidance in a heavy ECM environment.

Each missile is launched by 4 solid-fueled strap-on rocket boosters. After they burn out and drop away (between 3 and 5.1 seconds from launch) it fires a 5D67 liquid fueled sustainer rocket engine (for 51150 seconds) which burns a fuel called TG-02 Samin (50% xylidine and 50% triethylamine), oxidized by an agent called AK-27P Melange (red fuming nitric acid enriched with nitrogen oxides, phosphoric acid and hydrofluoric acid).[8] Maximum range is between 150 km (81 nmi) and 300 km (160 nmi), depending on the model. The missile uses radio illumination mid-course correction to fly towards the target with a terminal semi-active radar homing phase. Maximum target speed is around Mach 6 for new model and Mach 4 for earlier model. Effective altitude is 300 m (980 ft) to 20,000 m (66,000 ft) for early models and up to 35,000 m (115,000 ft) for later models. The warhead is either 217 kg (478 lb) high-explosive fragmentation (16,000 × 2 g fragmentation pellets and 21,000 × 3.5 g pellets) triggered by radar proximity fuse or command signal, or a 25 kt nuclear warhead triggered by command signal only. Each missile weighs around 7,108 kg (15,670 lb) at takeoff.
        
The system utilises radio semi active guidance throughout the missile's flight, which is far more accurate at long range than the command guidance method used by the earlier S-75 Dvina and other missiles.[citation needed] The existence of an optional terminal passive radar homing mode for use against airborne early warning (AEW) aircraft remains unconfirmed.[citation needed] Peak missile speed is around Mach 8 and the single-shot kill probability is quoted as 0.85, presumably against a high altitude bomber-type target.

The aging SA-5 was originally designed to counter extreme-altitude U.S. bombers. As a result, this missile is extremely fast, has a high ceiling and a large warhead. Of course, since it has had no success hitting modern aircraft, the warhead is relatively useless. Recognizing its limitations, the users of this missile employ it to force aircraft to take evasive actions and drop altitude. When this happens, anti-aircraft artillery takes over.

This SAM system consists of three missiles mounted on a tracked launch vehicle and can be used in conjunction with a separate dedicated radar vehicle. This arrangement greatly enhances the accuracy of these missiles.
                
The first combat use of the SA-6 occurred in the 1973 Yom Kipper War. The missile&apos;s capabilities surprised the Israelis; SA-6s shot down 20 of their aircraft in the first few days of the war. Israel lost additional aircraft when SA-6s forced them into the engagement envelopes of ZSU-23-4 Shilkas. The Israelis quickly changed tactics, reprogrammed their RWR and ECM systems, and effectively neutralized the SA-6 threat. Israel&apos;s losses were tempered by the fact that the same SA-6 batteries killed more than 50 friendly Egyptian and Syrian aircraft.
                
While these missiles are less effective against modern aircraft and countermeasures, pilots still need to be cautious when encountering the Gainful. The SA-6 failed to score any hits on Coalition aircraft during the Gulf War, but a Bosnian-Serb battery did manage to shoot down an F-16 participating in United Nations &quot;No-Fly&quot; Zone operations in 1995.

Any pilot unfortunate enough to encounter a squad of ground troops armed with this weapon is in for an unpleasant surprise. These shoulder-launched SAMs have IR guidance and home in on exhaust pipes. Fortunately, this also proves to be a weakness. The SA-7 must be fired directly at the rear of an aircraft in order to get a lock, and it is exceptionally vulnerable to flare countermeasures. Even if one of these missiles hits a plane, there&apos;s no guarantee that the aircraft will be taken out. As a result, the Grail is primarily a defensive weapon.
                
The HN-5A is a Chinese variant of the SA-7 with improved capabilities. It&apos;s performance places the HN-5A mid-way between the SA-7 and the SA-14.

Engagement range for the early versions is approximately 2 9 km (1.3 5.6 miles) and engagement altitudes of between 505,000 m (16416,400 ft). The 9M33M2 &quot;Osa-A&quot; missile extends the ranges out to 1,50010,000m (16.2 miles) and engagement altitudes to 255,000 m (8216,400 ft). The 9M33M3 missile greatly enhances the altitude engagement envelope to 1012,000 m (3342,500 ft), and as such are also able to fly further (about 15 km/9 miles) but the system is not able to engage targets at longer ranges, due to other factors such as the radar tracking of the missiles. The system is designed for use primarily against jet aircraft and helicopters in any kind of weather.
           
The 9M33 missiles are 3.158 m (10.3 ft) long, weigh 126 kg (278 lb) and use command guidance. There is also a backup low-light optical tracking system for heavy ECM environments. The latest 9M33M3 missiles have an increased total weight of 170 kg (375 lb) in order to provide the extended range coverage and larger warhead. Propulsion is provided by a dual-thrust solid fuel rocket motor. Both versions feature a missile speed of around Mach 2.4 (peaking at around Mach 3) for a maximum target engagement speed of around Mach 1.4 for the original missile and Mach 1.6 for the M2\M3 missiles. The warhead for the initial and M2 versions weighs 19 kg (42 pounds), increased to 40 kg (88 lb) in the M3 version to improve performance against helicopters. All versions have impact and proximity fuzes.
        
There have been unconfirmed reports of other possible versions of the missile with both infra-red and semi-active radar terminal homing seekers.
         
Each TELAR is able to launch and guide two missiles against one target simultaneously. Kill probability is quoted as being 0.350.85 for the Osa and 0.550.85 for the Osa-AK and Osa-AKM (presumably depending upon target aspect, speed, maneuverability and radar cross section). Reaction time (from target detection to launch) is around 26 seconds. Time to prepare for engagements from being in transit is around 4 minutes and missile reloading takes around 5 minutes. Each battery of four TELARs is usually accompanied by two reload vehicles carrying 18 missiles in sets of three, with a crane mounted on the reload vehicles to assist in moving the missiles.
          
When launched the booster motor burns for two seconds, this permits the radar to gather and control it at very short ranges (about 1.6 km). The sustainer motor has a 15-second burn, bringing the missile to a top speed of about Mach 2. Once launched the missile is command-guided for the whole flight, and the warhead is detonated by its proximity fuze or possible command. The warhead is said to have a lethal radius of 5 m at low altitude against a F-4 Phantom size target.

The SA-8 is a quad missile launch system that was intended to replace less mobile towed anti-aircraft guns. The launch vehicle comes equipped with its own radar system and carries an extra eight missiles for reloads. The stand-alone nature of this system, as well as the amphibious- and air-portability of the launch vehicle, make it capable of getting to and firing from a wide variety of areas normally inaccessible to SAM systems.
        
Osa was the first mobile air defense missile system incorporating its own engagement radars on a single vehicle.
        
All versions of the 9K33 feature all-in-one 9A33 transporter erector launcher and radar (TELAR) vehicles which can detect, track and engage aircraft independently or with the aid of regimental surveillance radars. The six-wheeled transport vehicles BAZ-5937 are fully amphibious and air transportable. The road range is about 500 km.
       
The 1S51M3-2 radar system on the 9K33 Osa TELAR received the NATO codename Land Roll. It was derived from the naval Pop Group radar system but is smaller since it does not require the elaborate stabilisation system. An improved system, the Osa-AKM (NATO reporting name SA-8B Gecko Mod 1) was first seen in Germany in 1980. It had improvements added to the launcher configuration, carrying six missiles in ribbed containers. The system is reported to be of the frequency-agile monopulse type. It consists of an elliptical rotating surveillance antenna mounted on top of the array, operates in H band (6 to 8 GHz) and has a 30 km acquisition range against most targets. The large pulsed J band (14.5 GHz) engagement antenna is mounted below it in the centre of the array and has a maximum tracking range of about 20 km.

The SA-9 Gaskin is a low altitude SHORAD system mounted on a modified BRDM-2 chassis. The original turret is replaced by a quadruple launcher for the missiles. Initially, the SA-9 was equipped with the Strela-1 (9M31) missile. This is the 9A variant. Later on, it was supplemented with the 9M31M, an improved version of the Strela-1, which had better range and improved seeker and lock on capabilities and is known as the 9B variant.
                
Of the transport erector launchers (TELs) of a SA-9 battery, one is equipped with the FlatBox A passive radar detection antenna.
                
Export versions of the SA-9 air defense system are often complemented with the DOG EAR target acquisition radar. However, the DOG EAR radar system is not a geniune part of a SA-9 unit.

The SA-10 Grumble is a modern SAM system for strategic air defense. It covers the complete air space from high altitude down to below 100m. Its huge effective range of more than 100 km makes elimination difficult. There are concerns amongst western military that the SA-10&apos;s radar systems (varying between A and B models) might not be detectable by the AGM-88&apos;s on-board sensors, even when in range of the ARM.
The SA-10 is deployed together with a series of radar systems covering the various vertical engagement zones. The radar coverage of these is sufficient to engage cruise missiles.
                
SA-10 is using TVM (Track-Via-Missile) guided missiles. The guidance radar is capable of providing missile guidance when it is operating in the search and track mode, and the radar characteristics will not change even when a missile is airborne. The guidance radar&apos;s uplink transmissions to the missile will also resemble normal radar transmissions, and will not appear to the RWR as something out of the ordinary (unlike command guidance signals). As such, there is no way you can determine from RWR signature, if a missile has been launched. The radar will appear in search mode, and you may possibly see it track you, but you will never know if the SAM battery has fired.
                
SA-N-6 Grumble:
This is the naval version of the SA-10.

The SA-11 Gadfly is a medium-range, semi-active, radar-guided missile using solid-rocket propulsion that provides defense against high-performance aircraft and cruise missiles. The SA-11 is designed to take over the SA-6&apos;s role and offers significant improvements like being able to engage 6 targets simultaneously rather than one. The SA-11 system has also combined the radar and missile launcher onto one vehicle called a TELAR - Transporter Erector Launcher and Radar. The SA-11&apos;s radar, the Fire Dome, is a monopulse system, offering more resistance to ECM and much improved tracking abilities. The Snow Drift is an EW/ACQ radar associated with the SA-11 and provides excellent low-altitude coverage.
                
Single-shot kill probability is claimed to be 60-90% against aircraft, 30-70% against helicopters, and 40% against cruise missiles, a significant improvement over the SA-6.
The radar&apos;s tracking range extends from 70 km for high-flying targets to 20 km for NOE targets (100 ft). Tracking of helicopters hovering at 30 m can be accomplished from as far as 10 km.
The H/I-band Fire Dome monopulse guidance and tracking engagement radar has an effective guidance range of 3-32 km and an altitude envelope of 15 meters to 22 km, and can engage approaching targets moving at a maximum of 3000 km/h (1860 mph). The radar guides as many as three missiles against a single target.
                
Special note:
Since the Long Track can be associated to SA-4, SA-6, SA-8 and SA-11, long track will be displayed as &quot;S&quot; symbol.

S-300V (NATO reporting name SA-12 GLADIATOR/GIANT)
                
The V suffix stands for Voyska (ground forces). It was designed to act as the top tier army air defence system, providing a defence against ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and aircraft, replacing the SA-4 &apos;Ganef&apos;.
                
A typical S-300V battalion is made up out of a target detection and designation unit, a guidance radar and up to 6 TELARs.
                
This is the anti-aircraft version of the S-300V with 4 x 9M82 GLADIATOR missiles.

The Strela-10 system was originally designed to use the 9M37 missile as its primary weapon, but its launch system was designed to be also backwards compatible with the 9M31M missile of the earlier 9K31 Strela-1 (SA-9 &quot;Gaskin&quot;) system.
                        
Each 9M37 missile is 2.2 m (7.2 ft) long, weighs 40 kg (88 pounds) and carries a 3.5 kg (7-15 pound) warhead. The maximum speed of the missile is near Mach 2, engagement range is from 500...800 to 5000 m (0.33 miles) and engagement altitude is between 10 and 3500 m (33-11,500 ft). (The ranges define the zone of target intercept, minimum and maximum launch distances are longer for approaching and shorter for receding targets, depending on the target's speed, altitude and flight direction.)
          
Four missiles are mounted on the turret in boxes, ready to launch, and eight more are carried inside the vehicle as reloads. Reloading takes around 3 minutes.
        
The 9M37 was quickly replaced with a slightly improved 9M37M (main improvement was in more efficient autopilot system for missile flight path control), and later the more significantly upgraded 9M333, which introduced:
    heavier warhead of improved expanding-rod design and larger HE content
    new proximity fuzing with 8-ray laser to improve probability of fuzing on near misses of very small targets such as cruise missiles or UAVs
    triple-channel guidance system for more robust countermeasure rejection
    improved engine to provide similar performance despite the slight increase in missile length and weight.
        
All missiles9M31M, 9M37, 9M37M and 9M333are equipped with optical homing heads utilizing reticle-based photocontrast and/or infrared homing. 9M333 is said to have particularly good countermeasures resistance due to its triple-channel homing head, while the photocontrast channel of 9M37/9M37M is described as back-up method to the IR channel.
       
All main variantsStrela-10SV, Strela-10M, Strela-10M2 and Strela-10M3can use all aforementioned missile types.
        
The main characteristics of the missiles are listed in the table below, based on source number, unless otherwise noted. For comparison purposes data for nearest western equivalent, the somewhat larger and heavier MIM-72 Chaparral, is also provided.
       
As the photocontrast channel provides effective head-on engagement ability, firing range against an approaching target can be considerably longer than the maximum ranges listed above, likewise maximum firing range would be considerably less than the maximum range of target destruction against a receding target. Definition of range and effective ceiling for MIM-72 is unknown and the figures are therefore not directly comparable.

The SA-13 is the replacement system for the SA-9 &quot;Gaskin.&quot; The launch vehicle has four launch rails and is capable of firing either SA-9s or SA-13s. While the SA-13 is infrared-guided like the SA-9, it is better able to discriminate flares from targets and has an additional range-only radar system to ensure that ammo isn&apos;t wasted on targets beyond its range.

Infantry armed with the SA-14 pose a considerable threat to aircraft. Based on the SA-7, the Gremlin has a warhead nearly double the size, with increased range as well. Furthermore, it has less chance of chasing flares and is less likely to be fooled by reduced heat profiles from targets. It also features improvements that allow it to be fired from a greater variety of angles. As a result, this weapon needs to be taken much more seriously than its predecessor.
       
The most significant change over the Strela 2 was the introduction of an all-new infra-red homing seeker head. The new seeker worked on FM modulation (con-scan) principle, which is less vulnerable to jamming and decoy flares than the earlier AM (spin-scan) seekers, which were easily fooled by flares and even the most primitive infrared jammers. The new seeker also introduced detector element cooling in the form of a pressurized nitrogen bottle attached to the launcher.
              
The effect of cooling was to expand the seeker's lead sulphide detector element's sensitivity range to longer wavelengths (slightly over 4 µm as opposed to 2.8 µm of uncooled PbS elements). In practice this made possible the tracking of cooler targets over longer ranges, and enabled forward-hemisphere engagement of jets under favourable circumstances. The seeker also had better tracking rate, enabling the missile to track maneuvering of fast and approaching targets.
                 
A negative side effect from the aforementioned improvements was increased missile weight, which caused a slight decrease in the kinematic performance of the original Strela-2 (SA-7). Against relatively slow, low-altitude battlefield air threats the overall effectiveness was much improved.
              
Strela-3 missiles have been exported to over 30 countries.
               
The original Strela-3 missile was the 9M36. The follow-on to the Strela-3 was Igla.
            
The naval version of this missile has the NATO reporting name of SA-N-8.

The SA-15 is an advanced SAM system, consisting of two sets of four missiles. While relatively little is known about the Gauntlet, it is believed that these weapons are capable of intercepting incoming missiles and other guided weapons in addition to aircraft. The launchers come equipped with their own tracking systems, which are capable of targeting 48 targets at once and automatically categorizing the top 10 most dangerous threats. With its all-weather intercept abilities and great speed, the SA-15 constitutes a major air threat.

SA-16 Gimlet (Igla-1 9K310) man-portable surface-to-air missile system, a further development from the SA-7 and SA-14 series, is an improved version of the SA-18 Grouse, which was introduced in 1983, three years before the SA-16. It has a new seeker which is sensitive enough for all aspect firing. Flare rejection is boosted by the seeker&apos;s ability to switch to ultra-violet.
        
The SA-16 has been attributed to the downing of an AC-130H (January 31), an F-16 (February 27); a UH-60 helicopter (February 27), four AV-8B Harriers (January 28 - February 27) and a Tornado (January 18) by Iraq during Desert Storm in 1991.
       
The SA-16 was also successfully used over Kosovo, shooting down a U.S. F-16C Block 40 on May 2, 1999.

SA-17 Grizzly (Russian designation &quot;Buk M1-2&quot;) is a new mobile SAM system to augment and eventually replace the SA-11 Gadfly. It now has the capability to engage tactical ballistic missiles as well as anti-radiation missiles such as the HARM.
                
Notes:
The new system uses the same launch vehicle chassis as, and overall has a configuration similar to the SA-11 Gadfly. The new SA-17 Grizzly system has increased fire power, and guarantees hits against six targets incoming simultaneously from different directions and at different altitudes.

The GRAU index lists the &quot;Tunguska&quot; system as 2K22, although the army designation 9K22 is also a valid reference. A complete system or battery consists of six 2S6 combat vehicles armed with the 9M311 &quot;Treugol'nik&quot; (triangle) surface-to-air missile and two 2A38 30 mm cannons. These are accompanied by up to three 2F77 transloader trucks. The 2K22 is also associated with a variety of support facilities including the 2F55, 1R10 and 2V110 repair and maintenance vehicles, the MTO-AGZ workshop and the 9V921 test vehicle and others. These facilities provide maintenance for the 2K22 battery in the field as well as scheduled overhauls. Each system can attack six targets simultaneously (1 for each machine 2S6). Minimum height of defeat 0 meters for guns and rockets to 15 meters (original 2K22).
Tunguska at 2008 Moscow Victory Parade.
       
The 2S6 combat vehicle uses the GM-352 and later GM-352M chassis developed and produced by the Minsk Tractor Plant (MTZ) which has six road wheels with hydropneumatic suspension on each side, a drive sprocket at the rear and three return rollers. An NBC system is also integrated into the chassis, which is protected -as the entire vehicle- from small arms fire (7,62) and shell splinters by the armor, as well as an automatic fire suppression system, an automatic gear change and diagnostic capability are available with latest Tunguska-M1 which uses the new GM-5975 chassis developed and produced by MMZ. GM-5975.25 has a cruising range of 500 km and a maximum speed of 65 km per hour. It can function at a relative humidity of 98 per cent at 35 degrees C, in ambient temperatures of -50 degrees C to 50 degrees C and up to an altitude of 3,000 m. It has an ability of climb up to 35 degrees, can cross slopes of 25 degrees, 2 m width ditch, 1 m depth ford.Overall, the layout is similar to the previous ZSU-23-4 with a large central 360-degree rotating turret (designated the 2A40) containing the armament, sensors and three of the crew: the commander, gunner and radar operator. The driver sits in the front left of the hull, with a gas turbine APU to his right and the multi-fuel diesel engine in the rear of the hull.
       
An electromechanically scanned parabolic E-band (10 kW power) target acquisition radar is mounted on the rear top of the turret that when combined with the turret front mounted J-band (150 kW power) monopulse tracking radar forms the 1RL144 (NATO:Hot Shot) pulse-Doppler 3D radar system, which can detect and track targets flying high as 3,500 m. Alongside the 1A26 digital computer and the 1G30 angle measurement system form the 1A27 radar complex. Tunguska-M has the 1RL144M radar with detection range 18 km and tracking range 16 km-near of the original system's. The mechanically scanned target acquisition radar for the Tunguska-M1 offers a 360-degree field of view, a detection range of around 18 km and can detect targets flying as low as 15 m, the target acquisition radar can be stowed when in transit. Its tracking radar has a range of 16 km. A C/D-band IFF system is also fitted and designated 1RL138. The radar system is highly protected against various types of interference, and can work if there are mountains on the horizon, regardless of the background. The system is able to fire on the move using 30 mm cannons, although it must be stationary to fire missiles. The maximum target speed can be up to 500 m/s; reaction time 68 seconds. Each 2S6 has all facilities for independent warfare.
       
Standard equipment of the 2S6 and 2S6M includes a computerized fire control system, heating, ventilation, NBC system, an automatic fire detection and suppression system, navigational equipment, night vision aids, 1V116 intercom, external communications system with an R-173 receiver -modernized in the 2S6M for better communication with the command post- and monitoring equipment. The vehicle also has protection against the effects of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.
      
Can work in passive mode (day + night+all weather). The biggest maneuver of possible with an overload 35g. This allows confidently hit strongly maneuvering target.
       
A battery of six Tunguska can automatically receive fire control information via an encrypted radio link, this allows targets to be distributed between individual units from a Ranzhir or PPRU battery command post, which can receive target information from either AWACS or early warning radar or in the case of the PPRU its own radar equipment.
      
The Tunguska has never seen combat.

The SA-6 GAINFUL is a two stage, solid-fuel, low-altitude SAM. It has radio command guidance with semi-active radar terminal homing. The 3M9 KUB self-propelled surface-to-air tactical low-altitude antiaircraft missile system is intended for destruction of aircraft, missiles, cruise missiles and assault helicopters at low to medium altitudes. The system was developed by the Russian TOROPOV OKB-134 company and produced by Vympel MKB and NIIP. It first entered operational service in 1970. The system is characterised by a very good mobility even in demanding cross-country conditions, and by a high speed of its anti-aircraft missiles achieving up to M =2.8, which permits to destroy even highly manoeuvring air targets. Each battery has its own STRAIGHT FLUSH (IS-91) fire control radar, four launchers on an armoured carrier chassis, and four transport and support vehicles. The system can carry out combat activities in a totally independent manner - it can search, automatically track and recognise air targets, illuminate them and provide anti-aircraft missiles homing. The system can guide three missiles to one target at any given time. It can automatically track up to 6 air targets and control 2 missiles at the same time. Reloading of the missiles from transport vehicle to launcher takes about 10 minutes. A built-in TV camera with the range of 25 km range increases the resistance of the system against EW. The last SA-6B Gainful Mod 1 version with increased EW resistance was produced till 1992.
                
Development of the 3M9 antiaircraft missile for the Kub [Cube] system ended the career of Ivan Ivanovich Toporov, founder of the OKB-134 Special Engineering Office. The missile designed had not been experimentally verified, and it became necessary not only to build the missile but also to simultaneouly conduct basic research. During the initial test launch in 1961, the 3M9 missiles disintegrated in the air. The associated aerodynamic, engine, and guidance problems compelled Toporov to ask the Ministry of Armaments to extend the deadline for submitting the 3M9 to governmental tests. Toporov was removed from his post of chief engineer at the end of August 1961, becoming department chairman at the Moscow Institute of Aviation, and replaced by Andrey Lyapinov as director of the team. This did not accelerate the work on the 3M9.
                
Finally in 1966 the missile together with all the Kub equipment was certified as an operational weapon, and it turned out to be one of the most successful Russian antiaircraft missiles. Although it is frequently reported that a naval version of the missile is the SA-N-3 GOBLET, this is evdiently not the case.
                
The SA-6a missile has a length of 5.7 meters, body diameter of 0.335 meters, a wing span of 1.245 meters, a tail span of 1.524 meters and has a launch weight of 599 kilograms with a 56 kilogram HE-fragmentation warhead. The proximity and contact fuses are armed after some 50 meters of flight. The basic SA-6a has a maximum effective range of 24,000m and has a minimum effective range of 3,000m, the minimum engagement height is 100m when using the fire control (STRAIGHT FLUSH) radar and 80m when in the optical tracking mode, the maximum effective altitude is about 11,000m.
                
A battery is able to relocate to an alternate firing position in approximately 15 minutes from systems being shutdown. In 1977, a new version - the SA-6b Gainful, was mounted on an SPU medium-tracked transporter. The SPU carried three SA-6b missiles and also an associated FIRE DOME H/I-band missile guidance illuminator radar is fitted on the front end of the launcher assembly. Reload missiles are carried on modified 6x6 trucks and are loaded manually onto the launcher by a crane carried on the rear of the loader vehicle. Reloading an TEL takes approximately 10 minutes.
                
The STRAIGHT FLUSH fire control radar has a maximum range of 55 - 75km and a 10,000m altitude capability depending upon the conditions and target size, and performs limited search, low altitude detection and/or acquisition, pulse Doppler IFF interrogation, target tracking &amp; illumination, missile radar command guidance and secondary radar missile tracking functions. Some modified fire control (STRAIGHT FLUSH) radars use a TV camera with a 30km range to enable the battery to remain in action even if the vehicle&apos;s radar is jammed or forced to shut down due to threats from anti-radiation missiles. This radar can also be linked to the launch vehicles by either a radio data link or a 10m long cable for direct data input to the launcher&apos;s systems. The data link antenna is carried on the right forward hull corner of the TEL. It also carries the fire control computers for the SA-6 Gainful missile battery.
                
The foldable 28km range dish antenna is of the conical scanning type and is used for low altitude H-band sector search scans, target tracking and target illumination. The lower parabolic antenna is the G-band medium altitude target acquisition and early warning radar with a 55-75km range, with the lower feed for medium to high altitude coverage and the upper feed for low altitude coverage.
                
The STRAIGHT FLUSH fire control radar can begin target acquisition at its maximum range of 75km, and begin tracking &amp; illumination at 28km. The STRAIGHT FLUSH radar can only illuminate a single target and control three missiles at any one time so normal practice when a target track has been initiated is to normally order the launch of two and sometimes three weapons from one or more TELs.

The S-300PMU [SA-10 land-based, SA-N-6 naval version] surface-to-air missile system is able to engage a number of targets simultaneously, countering intensive aircraft raids at low-to-high altitude. The SA-10 offers significant advantages over older strategic surface-to-air missile systems, including multitarget handling and engagement characteristics, a capability against low altitude targets with small radar crosssections such as cruise missiles, a capability against tactical ballistic missiles, and possibly a potential to intercept some types of strategic ballistic missiles.
                
The first SA-10 site became operational in 1980. Over 80 sites were operational by 1987, when work was progressing on at least another 20 sites. Nearly half of these sites were located near Moscow. This emphasis on Moscow as well as the deployment patterns noted for the other SA-10 sites suggested a first priority on terminal defense of command-and-control, military, and key industrial complexes. A program to replace all of the older strategic SAM systems with the SA-10, well under way by 1996, has been considered by experts to be one of the most successful reequipment programs of the post-Soviet armed forces.
                
This vertically launched missile uses a single-stage solid propellant rocket motor. It is normally armed with a 100 kg HE-fragmentation warhead with a proximity fuse, though a low yield tactical nuclear type is believed to be an alternative warhead option. The missile&apos;s vertical launch trajectory provides fastest available reaction time capability to counter targets approaching from any azimuth. Missile engagement altitude extend from 25 m up to about 30,000 m. The maximum engagement range is stated as at least 90000 m, though in practice it is probably greater.
                
The SA-10A launch complex consists of a missile battery which includes a battery command post and engagement control center, the large CLAM SHELL 3D continuous wave pulse Doppler target acquisition radar, the FLAP LID A I-band multi-function hased-array trailer-mounted engagement radar with digital beam steering in hardened sites, and up to 12 semi-trailer erector-launchers which mount four tubular missile container-launchers. The towing unit for the semi-trailer erector-launcher is the KrAZ-260V (6 x 6) tractor truck. The launchers are usually positioned on concrete pads with the trailers being leveled by the use of four hydraulic jacks. An S-300PMU Regiment comprises three such batteries and employs the BIG BIRD 4 meter tall F-band long-range, 3D surveillance and tracking radar at the Regimental command post for initial target detection.
                
First generation of the S-300 system like the PT/PT-1/PS versions use the 5V55 missile family including 5V55K missile with a range of 47 km, the 5V55R missile with a range of 75 km, 5V55KD missile with a range of 90 km. In 1992 a much more capable 5V55U missile with a range of 150 km was introduced. All of these missiles have high-explosive warheads. There is also a 5V55V missile with nuclear warhead. However it is no longer deployed.

The SA-11 GADFLY is a medium-range, semi-active, radar-guided missile using solid-rocket propulsion that provides defense against high-performance aircraft and cruise missiles. The SA-N-7 GADFLY is the naval Version of the SA-11.
                
The SA-11 represents a considerable improvement over the earlier SA-6 GAINFUL system, and can engage six separate targets simultaneously, rather than the single target capability of the SA-6. Singleshot kill probability are claimed to be 60-90% against aircraft, 30-70% against helicopters, and 40% against cruise missiles, a significant improvement over the SA-6. The system is more mobile, taking only about 5 minutes to move from road march to engagement. The new system also offers significantly greater resistance to ECM than previous systems. The SA-11 system is comprised of the TELAR (9A310M1), Loader/Launcher (9A39M1), SNOW DRIFT Surveillance Radar (9S18M1), and Command and Control vehicle (9S470M1).
                
The Mach 3 semi-active homing 9M28M1 missile has a maximum slant range of 28 km and a minimum range of 3 km. It is capable of engaging targets between altitudes of 30 and 14000 m and can sustain 23 g maneuvers. The solid fuel missile is 5.6 meters long with a diameter is 0.4 m and a wing span is 1.2 m. The launch weight is 650 kg, which includes a 70 kg HE warhead with a 17 meter lethal radius. The SNOW DRIFT warning and acquisition radar provides target height, bearing and range data. The SNOW DRIFT has a detection range of 85 km against high-flying targets, 35 km against targets at an altitude of 100 meters, and 23 km against targets flying nap-of-the-earth (NOE). The radar&apos;s tracking range extending from 70 km for high-flying targets to 20 km for NOE targets. Tracking of helicopters hovering at 30 m can be made as far as 10 km. Once a target is identified it is turned over to an TELAR via a data link for tracking and attack. The SNOW DRIFT receives early warning from brigade-level surveillance radars such as the SPOON REST.
                
The H/I-band FIRE DOME monopulse guidance and tracking engagement radar has an effective guidance range of 3-32 km and an altitude envelope 15 meters to 22 km, and can engage approaching targets moving at a maximum of 3000 km/h (1860 mph). The radar guides as many as three missiles against a single target.
                
The 9M38 uses a single-stage X-winged design without any detachable parts; its exterior design is similar to the American Tartar and Standard surface-to-air missile series, which led to the half-serious nickname of Standardski.[36] The design had to conform to strict naval dimension limitations, allowing the missile to be adapted for the M-22 SAM system in the Soviet Navy. Each missile is 5.55 m (18.2 ft) long, weighs 690 kg (1,520 lb) and carries a relatively large 70 kg (150 lb) warhead which is triggered by a radar proximity fuze. In the forward compartment of the missile, a semi-active homing radar head (9E50, Russian: 9?50, 9?50?1), autopilot equipment, power source and warhead are located. The homing method chosen was proportional navigation. Some elements of the missile were compatible with the Kub&apos;s 3M9; for example, its forward compartment diameter (33 cm), which was less than the rear compartment diameter.
                
The 9M38 surface-to-air missile utilizes a two-mode solid-fuel rocket engine with total burn time of about 15 seconds; the combustion chamber is reinforced by metal. For the purpose of reducing the centering dispersion while in flight, the combustion chamber is located close to the center of the missile and includes a longer gas pipe. The 9M38 is capable of readiness without inspection for at least 10 years of service. The missile is delivered to the army in the 9Ya266 (9?266) transport container.
                
The 9?38M1 missile uses active homing when approaching the goal.

The Tor-M1 is the successor to the Osa (NATO: SA-8 Gecko) surface-to-air missile (SAM) system. The 9K331 Tor [SA-15 GAUNTLET land-based, SA-N-9 naval version] low-to-medium altitude SAM system is capable of engaging not only aircraft and helicopters but also RPVs, precision-guided weapons and various types of guided missiles.
                
The principal advantages of Tor-M1 is its ability to simultaneously destroy two targets in any weather or at any time of day and night; the use of both the powerful and jamming-resistant radar with electronic beam control and vertically launched missiles able to maintain high speed and manoeuvrability inside an entire engagement envelope; the high degree of automation of combat operation provided by the electronic equipment suite. Tor detects targets at a distance of 25 kilometers and kills them at a distance
of 12 kilometers. In combating manned aviation, Tor is thrice and 1.5 times more efficient than foreign systems of the same class - France&apos;s Crotale and Britain&apos;s Rapier, respectively. The HQ-17 is a copy of Tor-M1, that China will use it to replace the aging HQ-61 SAMs, will enter service around the year 2005.
                
Although it is an autonomous system it can be interfaced into an integrated air defense network. SA-15b is designed to be a completely autonomous air defense system (at division level), capable of surveillance, command and control, missile launch and guidance functions from a single vehicle. The basic combat formation is the firing battery consisting of four TLARs and the Rangir battery command post. The TLAR carries eight ready missiles stored in two containers holding four missiles each. The SA- 15b has the capability to automatically track and destroy 2 targets simultaneously in any weather and at any time of the day.
                
The single stage solid propellant missile has a maximum speed of 850 m/s and is fitted with a 15 kg HEfragmentation warhead detonated by a proximity fusing system. The missile is approximately 3.5 meters long with a diameter of 0.735 meters and a launch weight 170 kilograms. The cold launch ejection system propels the missile upwards to a height of 18-20 meters, whereupon thruster jets ignite and turn the weapon to the target bearing. The main sustainer rocket motor then ignites and the missile is command guided to the intercept point where the proximity fuse is triggered.
                
Effective range limits are from 1500 to 12000 m with target altitude limits being between 10 and 6000 m. The maximum manoeuvring load factor limit on the weapon is 30 g.
                
the 9M330 missile is 3 m (10 ft) long, carries a 15 kg (33 lb) warhead and has a peak speed of around Mach 2.8. Using command guidance and radar controlled proximity fuzes, the missiles can maneuver at up to 30Gs and engage targets flying at up to Mach 2. Cold launched, the missiles are propelled out of the vehicle before the solid fuel rocket motor fires and the gas-dynamic maneuvering system turns them toward their target. Missiles can also be fired against surface targets. Each missile is a sealed round, stored in two groups of four. Engagement range is up to 12 km (0.8 to 6.47 nm) with minimum range varying between 1,500 to 2,000 m (328 to 5,621 feet), depending upon version and an effective altitude of 10 to 6,000 m (33 to 20,000 ft).[17]
                
A new 9M338 missile has been developed by Almaz Antey offering improved range and precision. Its smaller size also enables the modified Tor-M2 to be equipped with 16 missiles as opposed to the original 8.

The system uses the same 9M311 (NATO: SA-19/SA-N-11) missile family as the naval CIWS Kashtan which can engage targets at a range of 1.58 km and to an altitude of 5 m to 3.5 km,[5] the Tunguska-M1 uses the improved 9M311-M1 missile with an increased range of 2.510 km and an altitude of 15 m  3.5 km. The missile has two stages, a large booster stage with four folding fins, which boosts the missile to a velocity of 900 m/s, before falling away. The second stage has four fixed fins, and four steerable control surfaces. The complete missile is around 2.56 meters long with a weight of 57 kg.
                      
Guidance is performed by the target tracking radar, it constantly relays target range, elevation and bearing to the fire-control computer, and on the basis of this data the computer generates the laying commands for the guns or the trajectory corrections for the missiles. A back-up tracking method can be used by the gunner, who uses the 8× magnification (8 degree field of view) 1A29 stabilized sight of the Tunguska to track the target in elevation and azimuth, the altitude or range of the target being set manually. The gunner is initially cued towards the target by the system's search radar. Once the missile is steered to within 5 m of the target, an active laser or radio fuse (9M311-M1) is triggered. A contact fuse is also fitted. The warhead weighs about 9 kg, and is a continuous-rod system, consisting of 600 mm long, 6 to 9 mm diameter rods with a flower-like cross section. The cross section ensures the rods break into fragments weighing 23 grams. The rods form a complete ring about 5 m from the missile. Outside the rods is a fragmentation layer of steel cubes weighing 23 grams. The 2K22 is reported to have a kill probability of 0.6 with missiles (9M311).

SA-17 GRIZZLY is a new mobile SAM system to augment and eventually replace the SA-11 GADFLY. The new system uses the same launch vehicle chassis, and overall has a similar configuration to the SA-11 GADFLY. The SNOW DRIFT surveillance radar is also carried on the modified GM-569 tracked
vehicle chassis. Russia is upgrading the Belorussian Buk (NATO:SA-11 Gadfly) air defence missile system at the Uliyanovsk Mechanical Plant. The new Buk-M1-2 (SA-17 Grizzly) system has increased fire power, and guarantees hits against six targets flying simultaneously from different directions and at different altitudes.
                
The 9M317 is a family of medium-range surface-to-air missiles employing single-stage solid-state propulsion system capable of a top speed of Mach 3. The missile guidance combines inertial navigation with radio-correction (9M317M) and semi-active radar homing at the terminal leg of the trajectory. The warhead is detonated by a radar fuse or impact sensors. The missile family was introduced along the Shtil-1 air defense system in 2003
                
The Yezh naval version [SA-N-12] of the SA-17 is visually Identical to SA-N-7.
                
The HQ-16 is a joint development project between China and Russia that apparently represents a further evolution of the Russian Grizzly. The system would represent a significant overall improvement in Chinese air defense capabilities. The HQ-16 will reportedly have a range of 50 miles and the ability to hit both high and low flying targets.

Origin: Russia
Name: SAPSAN 5 
Type: Targeting Pod
Manufacture: Vympel 
Initial Operation Capability(IOC): 2006
			</CategoryDescription>
		</CategoryData>
		<DescriptionData>
This pod is made in accordance with the same technical assignment for Su-27 and MiG-29 airplanes, the chief designer of the Ural&apos;sk Optical-Mechanic Plant (UOMZ), Nikolay Rakovich, announced to ARMS-TASS at the Farnborough-2004 air salon.			         
According to him, &quot;recently aircraft podded targeting systems have enjoyed broad development in the world, therefore, we needed to revise the technical and economic task for the 'Sapsan' pod in the direction of an essential increase in a number of characteristics. Right now we are summarizing the requirements of potential Su-35 customer orders. The creation of a pod for this airplane will be the next stage of development in Russia of this direction of work. A number of parameters will be increased several times. Cooperation on the pod for the Su-35 also will be broadened appreciably."
                
Of the new systems at Farnborough-2004, the UOMZ presented the GOES-520 flight gyro-stabilized optoelectronic system which is intended for installation on Mi-28, Ka-50 and Ka-50-2 helicopters. Right now, according to N. Rakovich, the UOMZ is starting to market these systems to other types of forces- ground forces and the navy. In particular, the UOMZ is working on an upgrade program for the &quot;Shturm-SM&quot; land complex and the &quot;Kredo&quot; [credo] reconnaissance vehicle. The upgrade of the &quot;Palash&quot; [broadsword] complex and the &quot;Bark&quot; [bark] circular scan and targeting systems are the main directions in the naval theme.
                
The creation on the basis of the helicopter GOES systems for the protection of especially important objects which provides around-the-clock detection of unsanctioned penetration beyond the perimeter of an object being guarded is another direction of the operations. This system already has been presented at Domodedovo airport.
                
Answering an ARMS-TASS correspondent's question about cooperation with European countries, the UOMZ representative said that work is underway on the upgrade of a the Byelorussian armed forces fleet of Mi-24 helicopters. Right now upgrade is underway of a master helicopter on which flight tests of the GOES-321M surveillance and targeting system is undergoing tests. As a result of tests, a decision will be made about the installation of this system onto other Byelorussian military Mi-24 helicopters.
                
UOMZ is participating as a subcontractor in the upgrade of the Polish military's fleet of Mi-24 helicopters. Right now the main batch of helicopters is undergoing upgrade. Preliminary discussions are underway also with the Czech Republic, Hungary and Bulgaria.
                
The main volume of UOMZ product accounts for export orders. The state defense order for the upgrade of helicopters and the equipping of them with optoelectronic surveillance or surveillance and targeting systems is extremely small. Last year only 15 helicopters were upgraded according a line item of the ministry of defense and other force authorities. There is no state order for the upgrade and equipping of helicopters with UOMZ systems this year.

Usable from greater and greater safety distances, with unrivaled ease of use, the air-to-ground modular weapon (AASM) &quot;Hammer&quot;, developed by Safran Electronics &amp; Defense, enables extremely accurate strikes. The AASM is an autonomous unjammable interoperable modular device which utilizes leverages a range of guidance kits (INS/GPS, INS/GPS/Infrared and INS/GPS/Laser). The AASM has been tested in numerous recent theaters and delivers an excellent cost/effectiveness ratio.
                
AASM INS/GPS
The hybrid inertial/GPS layout is the standard guidance mode for coordinates. Once the coordinates have been entered in the weapon, the inertial guidance system enable it to hit the target without requiring a GPS signal, if it is unavailable. This version is designated the SBU-38 Hammer (Smart Bomb Unit).
The AASM&apos;s modularity allows it to be used on 125, 250, 500 and 1000kg bomb bodies. Its engine provides it with range greater than 50km, meaning it can be fired at a standoff distance. Autonomous after it has been dropped, it can be used at low altitudes, cross hilly terrain or veer sharply from the firing aircraft.

AASM INS/GPS IR
The inertial/GPS/IR kit adds an infrared imager for terminal guidance. With a simplified model of the scene around the target first being uploaded to the weapon, this imager allows the AASM to recalculate its trajectory during the last few seconds prior to impact, using image recognition algorithms. This allows the AASM to hit its target with the highest possible accuracy, even if GPS coordinates are incorrect, or the GPS signal is unavailable. This version is called the SBU-64 Hammer.
The AASM&apos;s modularity allows it to be used on 125, 250, 500 and 1000kg bomb bodies. Its engine provides it with range greater than 50km, meaning it can be fired at a standoff distance.

The BAE Systems Sea Harrier is a British naval VTOL/STOVL jet fighter, reconnaissance and attack aircraft, a development of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier. It first entered service with the Royal Navy in April 1980 as the Sea Harrier FRS1. The latest version is the Sea Harrier FA2. Informally known as the &quot;Shar&quot;, the Sea Harrier was withdrawn from Royal Navy service in March 2006.
                
In 1966 the planned CVA-01 class aircraft carriers for the Royal Navy were cancelled, apparently ending the Royal Navy&apos;s involvement in fixed-wing carrier aviation. However, beginning in the early 1970s, the first of a new class of &quot;through deck cruisers&quot; was planned, carefully named to avoid the term &quot;aircraft carrier&quot; to increase the chances of funding. These ships would eventually become the Invincible class aircraft carriers. With little modification, a &apos;ski-jump&apos; was added to the end of the 170m deck, enabling the carriers to operate a small number of STOVL jets.
                
Lessons learned from the aircraft&apos;s performance in the Falklands led to the requirement for an upgrade of the fleet, incorporating increased air-to-air weapons load, look-down radar, increased range, and improved cockpit displays. Approval for an upgrade to FRS.2 standard was given in 1984. First flight of the prototype took place on September 1988 and a contract was signed for 29 upgraded aircraft in December that year, with the upgraded aircraft to be known as the F/A.2 (later FA2). In 1990 the Navy ordered 18 new-build FA2s, at a unit cost of around £12 million, and a further 5 upgrades were ordered in 1994. The FA2 featured the Blue Vixen radar, which was described as one of the most advanced pulse doppler radar systems in the world. The Blue Vixen formed the basis for development of the Eurofighter Typhoon&apos;s CAPTOR radar. The FA2 carries the AIM-120 AMRAAM missile and was the first UK aircraft to be provided with this capability. The first aircraft was delivered on April 2, 1993 and the first operational deployment was in April 1994 as part of the UN force in Bosnia.
                
The final new-build Sea Harrier FA2 was delivered on January 18, 1999.

The Shirane-class destroyers were a pair of Japanese destroyers originally built during the late 1970s. They are built around a large central hangar which houses up to three helicopters and they are the natural successor of the Haruna-class destroyers. 
       
The Shirane class incorporates an improved design based on the Haruna-class destroyers. The ships propulsion include two steam boilers with two shafts that produce 70.000 hp and gives a maximum speed of 32 knots.
        
Its armament includes two Mk.42 127mm guns, two 20-mm Phalanx close-in weapon systems, one Surface-to-air RIM-7 Sea Sparrow launcher, torpedoes and anti-submarine rockets. The ships has been replaced by the new Izumo-class helicopter destroyers.

The British Aerospace Skyflash, or Sky Flash in marketing material, was a medium-range semi-active radar homing air-to-air missile derived from the US AIM-7 Sparrow missile and carried by Royal Air Force F-4 Phantoms and Tornado F3s, Italian Aeronautica Militare and Royal Saudi Air Force Tornados and Swedish Flygvapnet Viggens.
                
Skyflash replaced the original Raytheon conical scanning seeker with a Marconi inverse monopulse seeker that worked with the F-4&apos;s radar. Monopulse seekers are more accurate, less susceptible to jamming, and able to easily pick out targets at low altitudes. It offered significantly more performance than the original seeker, allowing them to dispense with upgrades to the warhead that were carried out in the US to address poor accuracy.
                
Skyflash was tested in the US, but after trials against experimental monopulse seekers from Raytheon, the US Navy selected to produce their own version, the AIM-7M. Both Skyflash and AIM-7M were later replaced by the more capable AMRAAM.
                
Designed to operate within severe electronic countermeasure conditions. Four can be carried by the Tornado ADV under the fuselage. The Skyflash was a development of the AIM-7E2 Sparrow. The weapon entered service with the RAF in 1978, originally for use by the F-4 Phantom.

The Italian Aspide, basically a licensed version of the American Sparrow, is similarly employed as both an air-to-air and surface-to-air missile, and in the later role it is launched from both ships and ground platforms. The AIM-7E Sparrow entered service in 1962 and was widely used as a standard for other variants such as the Sky Flash (UK) and Aspide (Italy). Alenia Difesa offers a complete range of systems, including the air to air and surface to air systems based on Aspide missile (Spada, Skyguard, Albatros, ARAMIS).
                
The Chinese PL-11 medium-range AAM is based on the Aspide, which was acquired by China in the late 1980s for use in the air-to-air roles, and as with the American and Italian version, subsequently in the LY-60 system modified for both ground and naval air defence applications. In reaction to the Tiananmen Square massacre, the European Council--an EU decision-making body comprised of ministers from EU member countries--imposed several sanctions in June 1989, including &quot;an embargo on trade in arms with China.&quot; The deliveries of Italian Aspide air-to-air missiles appear to have been made in connection with pre-embargo agreements. Although a contract for the Aspide system has been signed with Italian firm Alinea, the government in Rome had not given its permission to export the missiles to Cyprus, fearing the deployment would only fuel existing tensions.
                
Through Alenia Difesa, Finmeccanica offers a complete range of systems, including the surface to air systems based on the Aspide missile (Spada, Skyguard, Albatros, ARAMIS);

This point defense SAM/AAA fire control radar is employed for close-in defense of airfields and vital military installations. It uses the Aspide (exported AIM-7) missile and can control twin-barrel 35 mm GDF-005 AAA guns as well. The system is mobile; however, quite some time is needed to set up the site so normally these installations don&apos;t move very frequently.

The Sovremenny class, Soviet designation Project 956 Sarych (buzzard), is a class of anti-ship and anti-aircraft guided missile destroyers of the Soviet and later Russian Navy. The ships are named after qualities, with &quot;Sovremenny&quot; translating as &quot;modern&quot; or &quot;contemporary&quot;. Most of the ships have been retired from active service and one converted into a museum ship in 2018, but several remain in commission with the Russian Navy. Four modified ships were delivered to the People's Liberation Army Navy, and remain in service.
                        
The Sovremenny class were guided missile destroyers, primarily tasked with anti-ship warfare, while also providing sea and air defense for warships and transports under escort. The class was designed to complement the Udaloy-class destroyers, which were fitted primarily for anti-submarine operations.

The primary mission if the SPRUANCE-class destroyer, of which thirty-one ships are commissioned, is the anti-submarine warfare. For this role, the SPRUANCE-class vessels utilize highly developed weapons systems, including the Mk-32 torpedo and ASROCs (Anti Submarine Rocket). Sophisticated equipment to detect submarines allows these vessels to operate on submarines at considerable range even in adverse weather conditions. Two SH-60 SEAHAWK LAMPS III helicopters augment the submarine hunting capabilities of this destroyer class. More than that, the SPRUANCE-class can also engage air and surface threats.
                
In it&apos;s anti-air role, the SPRUANCE-class engages air targets at range by it&apos;s RIM-7M Sea Sparrow missiles. Air threats, which have managed to close in on the ship, are confronted with the vessel&apos;s 20mm CIWS anti-aircraft guns. Together with the Mk-23 TAS/NSSMS fire control radar, the SPRUANCE-class has a capable self-defense system.
                
To fullfill it&apos;s anti-surface role, the SPRUANCE-class has been back fitted with the Mk-41 VLS and can attack surface targets with it&apos;s Tomahawk Cruise Missiles. Twenty-four ships of the SPRUANCE-class have been upgraded with the Advanced Tomahawk Weapons Control System (ATWCS). By modern satellite and computer technology, it enables the SPRUANCE-class to fire up to sixty-one precision-guided Tomahawks with a range of up to 700 miles in surgical strikes.
                
The Spruance-class is as large as a WWII cruiser. It is the first class of ships in the US Navy propelled by gas turbines. The four turbines, which drive to the ship in excess of 30 knots, are marine shaft power versions of the engines known from the DC-10 and C-5A aircraft.
                
Traditionally, Navy destroyers are decommissioned after thirty years. But seven ships of the SPRUANCE-class, which didn&apos;t participate in the Tomahawk VLS upgrade, are to be decommissioned after twenty years to accomodate the introductio of the AEGIS-capable Arleigh Burke-class. These seven ships are scheduled to be scrapped.

The 5N62 Square Pair Guidance and Illumination Radar is the engagement radar for the 140 - 160 NMI range S-200 / SA-5 Gammon SAM system, the longest ranging of the Cold War era SAMs, and in 2009, still the longest ranging SAM in operational use.
                
Each 5N62 radar comprises two primary components, the K-1 and K-2 cabins, both towed to location. The K-1/K-1V/M Transmitter/Receiver cabin is the radio-frequency component of the 5N62 radar. The K-2/K-2V/M Fire Control Centre cabin, built into an OdAZ-828 semi-trailer van, houses the operator consoles, a digital computer and supporting electronics. It also is an integral part of the 5N62 radar system. Stow and deploy times for the whole radar system are 8 hours, as the knocked down antenna head has to be assembled from components or vice versa.
                
The 36 tonne gross weight K-1/K-1V/M Transmitter/Receiver cabin houses the 100.0 kiloWatt CW transmitter final stages, the 10-17 Watts sensitivity receiver, and mounts the two component 6.0 GHz band Continuous Wave antenna head. The larger parabolic section antenna is for the transmit path, the smaller parabolic section antenna for the receive path, with the dividing blade, termed a knife, employed to avoid spillover. The transmit and receive horns are mounted on the blade. The transmit beam mainlobe width cited by Russian sources is 0.7°.
                
An inflatable shelter is available for static installations of the complete K-1 antenna package.
                
Antenna steering in azimuth is effected by rotating the whole cabin and antenna head on the turntable coupling. Maximum slew rate is 20°/sec. Antenna steering in elevation is effected by tilting the complete antenna head about a rotational joint in the support frame.
                
The boom mounted circular polarised helical antenna on the side of the cluster is for the 5V21/5V28 missile uplink/downlink channel. The missile downlink is used to monitor missile status and health, the missile uplink is used to arm the proximity fuse, arm the warhead, and initiate the missile self destruct function. The modulations and signalling format have not been disclosed.

SR-71A: In July 1964, President Johnson announced that Lockheed was developing an advanced strategic reconnaissance platform. This was the next in sequence after the planned RS-70 reconnaissance derivative of the North American B-70 Valkyrie Mach 3 bomber, but the President read his briefing notes wrongly and referred to the new machine as the SR-71, and this official mistake was allowed to stand. By this time, the first SR-71A was approaching completion as the leader of an initial batch of six aircraft ordered by the U.S.A.F. in December 1962 to an improved A-12 standard for the strategic reconnaissance role with an internal fuel capacity of 12,200 U.S. gal (1,158.8 Imp gal; 4,6181.9 liters), greater weight and slightly more length to allow the incorporation of additional reconnaissance equipment as well as two more comfortable cockpits based on the two-seat accommodation of the M-12. This first machine flew in December 1964, and the SR-71A entered service in January 1966. Production totaled 32 aircraft, including one diverted to NASA on permanent loan with the fictitious designation YF-12C. The SR-71A was retired in the early 1990s.
                         
SR-71B: This was a single conversion from SR-71A standard as a two-seat pilot trainer with a raised second cockpit in place of the systems operator&apos;s position, and with the under-nacelle fin of the YF-12A.

The Scud is a mobile, Russian-made, short-range, tactical ballistic surface-to-surface (hence the nomenclature abbreviation SS) missile system. The SCUD-series guided missiles are single-stage, short-range ballistic missiles using storable liquid propellants. The Scud is derived from the World War II era German V-2 rocket. Unlike the FROG series of unguided missiles, the SCUDs have movable fins. Warheads can be HE, chemical, or nuclear, and the missile, launched vertically from a small platform, has a range of 300 km. Unsophisticated gyroscopes guided the missile only during powered flight - which lasts about 80 seconds. Once the rocket motor shut down, the entire missile with the warhead attached coasted unguided to the target area. Consequently, Scuds had notoriously poor accuracy, and the farther they flew, the more inaccurate they became. SCUD missiles are found in SSM (SCUD) brigades at front/army level. The SCUD series of missiles gave the Soviet front and army commanders an integral nuclear weapons capability. Non-nuclear variants of the SCUD missiles have been exported to both Warsaw Pact and non-Warsaw Pact nations.
                
Libya has been rumoured that Scud-Bs were fired by Gaddafi forces against rebels in the 2011 Libyan civil war during the first phase of the war. On 14 August 2011 a confirmed Scud-B launch was detected by a US Aegis destroyer, with the missile fired from Sirte and heading toward rebel positions in Ajdabiya. The missile fell 80 km off target in the middle of the desert, inflicting no damage. Eight days later, on August 22, three more Scud-B launches were detected by NATO.

The Typhoon ballistic missile nuclear-powered (SSBN) submarines are the largest submarines ever to be built. They were constructed at the Severodvinsk Shipyard, on the White Sea near Archangel.
                
The first of the six members of the class to be commissioned was TK 208 in 1981, followed by TK 202 in 1983, TK 12 in 1984, TK 13 in 1985, TK 17 in 1987 and TK 20 in 1989. The submarines were stationed with the Russian Northern Fleet at Litsa Guba.
                
Of the six, only TK 17 and TK 20 are operational. TK 208 was relaunched following refit in 2002 and is being used as a trials ship. TK 12 and TK 13 are decommissioned, waiting to be scrapped.
                
With assistance from the United States, through the cooperative threat reduction programme, TK 202 has had its nuclear fuel removed by US funded processing facilities and converted into forms suitable for long-term storage or reuse. The UK has also agreed to take part in the dismantling of Russia&apos;s decommissioned nuclear submarines.

The Soviet Union/Russian Navy Project 705 was a class of hunter/killer nuclear-powered submarines. The class is also known by the NATO reporting name of Alfa. They were the fastest class of military submarines built, with only the prototype K-222 (NATO Papa class) exceeding them in submerged speed.
                
The Lira was a unique design among submarines. In addition to the revolutionary use of titanium for its hull, it used a powerful lead cooled fast reactor as a power source, which greatly reduced the size of the reactor compared to conventional designs, thus reducing the overall size of the submarine, and allowing for very high speeds. However, it also meant that the reactor had a short lifetime and had to be kept warm when it was not being used. As a result, the Liras were used as interceptors, mostly kept in port ready for a high-speed dash into the North Atlantic.

The Russian Kilo Class submarine first entered into service in the early 1980s. It was designed by the Rubin Central Maritime Design Bureau, St Petersburg. Subsequent developments have led to the current production versions, the Type 877EKM and most recently, the Type 636. The submarines are constructed at the Admiralty Shipyard in St Petersburg.
                
24 Kilo Class submarines are in service in the Russian Navy (most of the older designs).
                
Kilo Class submarines have also been exported to Iran, China, India, Poland, Romania and Algeria. China has two Type 877EKMs, Iran has three Type 877EKM and India has ten Type 877EKM (Sindughosh Class). The Type 877EKM is designed for anti-submarine (ASW) and anti-surface ship (ASuW) warfare.

The steel-hulled submarines of the Project 971 Schuka-B, designated by NATO as Akula class were easier and cheaper to built than the Sierras, and are essentially successors to the prolific Victor class. Today, they make up about half of Russia&apos;s dwindling fleet of nuclear-powered attack submarines.
                
The first seven boats (designated in the West as the Akula I class) were constructed between 1982-90, and are the Puma, Delfin, Kashalot, Bars, Kit, Pantera and Narval. Five more (the Volk, Morzh, Leopard, Tigr and Drakon built between 1986-95) are classified as the Project 971 U or Improved Akula class, while a 13th boat, the Vepr of the Project 971M or Akula II class, was launched in 1995. Three additional boats the Belgograd and Kuguar launched between 1998-2000 as Akula II boats, are also incomplete. At least two more were projected but were not built. Nepra began sea trials in 2008. This boat was leased to India since 2011 until 2020. It was commissioned with the Indian Navy in 2012 as INS Chakra.
                
The design was approved in the early 1970s but modified in 1978-80 to carry the Granat (SS-N-21 Sampson) land attack cruise missiles. The Akula marked a significant improvement in Soviet submarine design as it is far quieter than the Victor and earlier SSNs. Furthermore it was far quitter than Western countries expected. The use of commercially available Western technology to reduce noise levels played an important role in this eroding a long-held NATO advantage in the underwater Cold War. Sensors were also much improved, the use of digital technology enabling them to detect targets at three times the range possible in a Victor.
                
The Akulas sport a massive tear-drop shaped pod on the after fin: this houses the Skat-3 VLF passive towed array. There is an escape pod built into the fin. The Improved Akula and Akula II boats are fitted with six additional 533-mm external torpedo tubes: as these cannot be reloaded from within the pressure hull, it is considered likely they are fitted with the Tsakra (SS-N-15 Starfish) anti-submarine missile. Additionally, the Akula II boats are credited with an increased operational diving depth.
                
The Vepr and Gepard boats of the Akula II class employ additional quieting measures. These became the first Russian submarines that were quieter than improved Los Angeles class, latest US attack submarines of that time.
                
Russian advances in sound quieting were considerable concern to the West. US Navy had enjoyed technological edge over the Soviets from 1945 until the mid-1980s. However in the late 1980s Soviets were catching up. In response the US Navy launched extremely advanced Seawolf class SSNs.
                
Four Akula I boats were paid off in the late 1990s and are unlikely to return, and they surviving boats are divided between the Northern and Pacific Fleets.
                
In the future the older Akula class boats will be replaced by the new Graney class nuclear-powered attack submarines.

The Los Angeles class boats are nuclear-powered fast attack submarines (SSN) in service with the United States Navy. The submarines are also known as the 688 class (pronounced &quot;Six-Eighty-Eight&quot;), after the hull number of lead vessel USS Los Angeles (SSN-688). They represent two generations and close to half a century of the Navy's attack submarine fleet. As of 2018, 35 of the class are still in commission and 27 are retired from service. Of the 27 retired boats, 12 were laid up half way (about 20 years or less) through their projected lifespans, and another five also laid up early (2025 years), due to their midlife reactor refueling being cancelled, and one was lost due to a fire. Seven have been scrapped and two are being converted to moored training ships. A further four boats were proposed by the Navy, but later cancelled. The class has more active nuclear submarines than any other class in the world. Submarines of this class are named after American towns and cities, such as Albany, New York; Los Angeles, California; and Tucson, Arizona, with the exception of USS Hyman G. Rickover, named after a US Navy Admiral. This was a change from long-standing tradition of naming attack submarines after marine animals, such as USS Seawolf or USS Shark.
                       
In 1982 after building 31 boats, the class underwent a minor redesign. The following eight that made up the second &quot;flight&quot; of subs had 12 new vertical launch tubes that could fire Tomahawk missiles. The last 23 had a significant upgrade with the 688i improvement program. These boats are quieter, with more advanced electronics, sensors, and noise-reduction technology. The diving planes are placed at the bow rather than on the sail, and are retractable.

The Oyashio class is a series of Japanese diesel-electric attack submarines operated by the JMSDF. The submarines entered service in the late 1990s. The submarines are larger than the earlier Harushio class, to provide space for a flank sonar array
         
There are a total of 11 boats in the class - the last boat was commissioned in 2008. Oyashio, Michishio, and Kuroshio share their names with World War II destroyers Takashio shares a name with a third set of Yugumo-class destroyers, of which none were built.
        
The first two boats, Oyashio and Michishio, have since been converted to training platforms.
         
On February 1, 2018, The Ministry of Defence's Maritime Staff Office, revealed that seven of the service's 82 m Oyashio-class submarines, which have a surface displacement of 2,800 tonnes - have already completed service-life extension work to date. The seven boats have received extensive refits during their second and third maintenance cycles, which have been planned to bring the vessels to almost the same level of that of the latest model Suryu-class submarine, while extending their service lives.

The Project 633 class (known in the West by its NATO reporting name as the Romeo class) is a class of Soviet diesel-electric submarine, built between 1957 and 1961. A Chinese variant - Type 033 - was built in China from 1962 to 1984. 
         
Project 633 was a further development of the Soviet navy's post-war 611 (Zulu-) and 613 (Whiskey-class) designs. The project was undertaken by Lazurit Central Design Bureau of Gorky.
          
Only 20 of the Soviet Union's originally intended 56 were completed between October 1957 and the end of December 1961 because of the introduction of the nuclear submarine into the Soviet Navy.
         
By today's standards Romeo class submarines are considered obsolete, but they still have some value as training and surveillance vessels.

The boats of the Seawolf class are the most advanced but also the most expensive hunter-killer submarines in the world. The first completely new American submarine design for some 30 years, the USS Seawolf was laid down in 1989 as the lead boat in a class of 12. The cost of the Seawolf class in 1991 was estimated at $33.6 billion (25 per cent of the naval construction budget), making it the most expensive naval building programme ever. At that time the US Navy planned an additional 17 boats. Then the peace dividend resulting from the collapse of the USSR and the end of the Cold War caused US politicians to question the need for more ultra-quiet boats, and the class was capped at three units and the replacement for the 51 current Los Angeles class boats became a much cheaper design of the Virginia class.
                
The Seawolf class was intended to restore the technological edge which the US Navy had enjoyed over the Soviets from 1945 until the mid-1980s, when espionage and the cynical trading practices of some US allies somewhat eroded it. The new boats were designed to operate at greater depths than existing US submarines and to operate under the polar ice cap. The Seawolf class boats were intended to seek and destroy the latest Soviet ballistic missile submarines, such as the Typhoon class and attack submarines such as the Akula class.
                
New welding materials have been used to join the hull subsections and the Seawolf class are the first attack submarines to use HY-100 steel rather than the HY-80 used for previous boats. (HY-100 was used in experimental deep-diving submarines during the 1960s).
                
The most important advantage of the Seawolf class design is its exceptional quietness even at high tactical speeds. Whereas most submarines need to keep their speed down to as little as 5 kts to avoid detection by passive sonar arrays, the Seawolf class are credited with being able to cruise at 20 kts and still be impossible to locate. The US Navy describes the Seawolf as 10 times as quiet as an improved Los Angeles and 70 times as quiet as the original Los Angeles boat: a Seawolf at 25 kts makes less noise than a Los Angeles tied up alongside the pier! However, during their construction and subsequent trials, several problems were experienced on the Seawolf after acoustic panels kept falling off the boat.
                
With eight torpedo tubes in a double-decked torpedo room, the Seawolf class are capable of dealing with multiple targets simultaneously. Now that the originally intended targets are rusting at anchor in Murmansk and Vladivostok, it is the Seawolf&apos;s ability to make a stealthy approach to enemy coasts that makes it so valuable. The third ant last unit, the USS Jimmy Carter, which was commissioned in December 2001, incorporates a dry deck shelter, for which its hull was lengthened by 30.5 m (100 ft). The dry deck hangar is an air transportable device than can be fitted piggy-back style to carry swimmer delivery vehicles and combat swimmers. There is a combat swimmer silo too, an internal lock-out chamber that can fit up to eight swimmers and their equipment. The irony of such a submarine being named after the president who bungled the Iran hostage rescue mission is not lost on older US Navy personnel!
                
All three of the boats can carry Tomahawk cruise missiles. These cruise missiles have a range of 1 700 km and are used to attack ships and land targets. The boats have eight 26-in (660-mm) torpedo tubes. A total complement of 50 Mk.48 torpedoes, Sub Harpoon anti-ship missiles and Tomahawk cruise missiles can be carried by the boats of the Seawolf class. Alternatively up to 100 marine mines can be carried in place of either the torpedoes or the cruise missiles.
                
It is thought that is the future the vessels may also be fitted for the carriage, deployment and recovery of Uninhabited Underwater Vehicles (UUVs). The state of the art electronic system on the boats features a BSY-2 sonar suite with an active or passive sonar array and a wide-aperture passive flank array; TB-16 and TB-29 surveillance and tactical towed arrays are also fitted. The class features a BPS-16 navigation radar and a Raytheon Mk 2 weapons control system. A countermeasures suite includes the Wly-1 advanced torpedo decoy system.
                
The boats have great maneuverability, and additional space was built into the class for improvements in weapons development. Despite their potent weapons load, their ultra-quietness, and their robust electronics fit, the Seawolf class are yet to be deployed in combat.

The SS-N-2 STYX is a ship launched medium-range anti-ship missile. P-15 - antiship cruise missile of sea basing with the liquid propellant rocket engine and the powder starting (SPRD-E0), with the autonomous system for administration + OF TGSN or ARLGSN. Glider - all-metal monocoque, midwing monoplane with wing and tail assembly of small lengthening. The wing spread in flight was for the first time designed and mastered by production. Wing in two versions: riveted and cast (prepared with new progressive method - the method of the squeezing of thin-walled panels). Fairing from the radio-transparent fiberglass laminate ASTT and the polystyrene PS -1. Tank cut off welded construction, the made from the material D -20, insertable oxidant tank - from AMG-E. Basic materials used: D -16T, D -20, AMG-&apos;, Ei-&apos;shchya, E0KHGSA, AMG-E. By special novelty in the technology of production is wing rocket it appeared the method of the squeezing of thin-walled panels. Idea and primary developments of this method belong to E. To s. stebakov (NIAT), who, after becoming acquainted with the construction of article P -15, proposed to pour off wings by this method. With great difficulty the chief metallurgist of plant A. S. zvyagin E. S. stebakov they convinced chief engineer yu. i. shuksta of the expediency of preparing the cast wing instead of the riveted and in the need continuation of these experimental works. Very for long scrupulously was mastered the folding &quot;book&quot; - installation for the squeezing. With the introduction of this method there were many difficulties: first crack, then uzhimy, underfillings and the like for long searched for composition for working of the folds of &quot;book&quot; before the filling - they found. Castings began to be obtained, but with their heat working strongly it warped - was lost outline and basic dimensions. Large it is working it was worthwhile to develop the one-piece steel rigging, in which the cut castings loaded into the heat treating furnace. The castings, which do not require mechanical processing on the theoretical contour, began to be obtained after this, and articles became to complete wings in the cast version. This became possible because of the risk and daring decision of chief engineer shukst Yuri Ivanovich, who at the critical moment, even with the not worked out to the end version of casting, forbade to make wings P-15 in the riveted version. This accelerated the process of the mastery of cast version, although the situation with the planned deliveries was critical at that time. During the subsequent years the aircraft plant in g. to arsen&apos;eve, where we communicated technical documentation on the series deliveries P -15, manufactured articles only with the cast wings.
                
In 1960 the production of aggregates by the method of squeezing was exposed at VDNKH - EXHIBITION OF ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMY OF THE USSR, where to the author- developers there was prisuzhdena silver medal, and to the executors of this method were entrusted prizes and rewards (V. d. chekushenkov, Yu. i. shukst, A. To s. zvyagin). It was rewarded with medal OF VDNKH - EXHIBITION OF ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMY OF THE USSR and with A. 4. birch grove, which much made for the success of this work.
                
During the mid-1970s efficient infra-red seekers were developed and used in the P-22 missiles (SS-N-2d) supplementing the P-21 as the prime anti-ship weapon of the Project 1241 and Project 206 Missile Cutters (Tarantul&apos; class corvettes and Matka&apos; class FACs which entered service in 1978. They were also used for coast defense purposes and received the NATO designation SSC-3 Styx&apos;.
                
It is the only ship-launched missile to have sunk large warships in action. On 21 October 1967 the Israeli destroyer Eilat was hit and sunk off Port Said by three missiles. Subsequently in the Holy Day War of 1973 the missile proved less effective with some 52 being fired without effect by Egyptian and Syrian naval units. One missile was destroyed in the air by a 76 mm gun.
                
The versions of the Styx&apos; missile are as follows:
P-15M Termit is an improved P-15 with folding wings and modified guidance system.
P-20 Rubezh is a redesigned P-15 with improved range, due to the use of new fuels. There is also some improvement to the radar range and to its lock-on capability, while the autopilots are further modified. It is possible that the guidance system in this version received an Indian-developed jamming system as an ECCM measure.
P-20M Rubezh is a P-20 with the MS-2A seeker. This has a solid-state radar with improved range, bearing accuracy, low-level detection capability and clutter suppression. The radar has six preset frequencies and several can be selected for use during the flight with the receiver opening for selected pulses. The radar has improved ECCM capabilities including the ability to home-on-jam.
P-21 Rubezh is a P-15 with infra-red seeker.
P-22 Rubezh is a P-20M with infra-red seeker. The infra-red seeker, whose sensor head projects from just below the nose, is used as a backup to the radar seeker if the latter is jammed. The sensor is reported to be extremely sensitive but no further details are available.
P-27 Rubezh is a P-20M with L-band seeker. In larger ships such as the Tarantul&apos; class corvettes the Square Tie&apos; radar is replaced by one with the NATO designation Plank Shave&apos;. This is another I-band system which is reported to have the Russian name Garpun.
                
The Styx&apos; missiles have been subject to extensive in-service modification, indeed Indian sources would suggest that each of the former Soviet Navy fleets may have adapted their missiles to meet anticipated local tactical conditions. It is reported that MS-2A and IR. sensors have been retrofitted into earlier missiles together with ECCM hardware. Indian sources suggest that improvements in seeker technology developed by the Defense Research and Development Laboratories in Hyderabad and the Naval Chemical and Metallurgical Laboratories in Vishakhapatnam were adopted into the missiles of the Soviet Navy.
                
The P-15 is manufactured in China, North Korea and India. It would appear that production of&apos; Styx&apos; has ceased in Russia but it may continue in India, North Korea and possibly Egypt.
                
User countries include Algeria, Angola, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cuba, Egypt, Ethiopia, Finland, India, Iraq, North Korea, Libya, Poland, Romania, Russia, Syria, Vietnam, Yemen, and Yugoslavia.

The P-270 Moskit is a Soviet supersonic ramjet powered anti-ship cruise missile. Its GRAU designation is 3M80, air launched variant is the Kh-41 and its NATO reporting name is SS-N-22 Sunburn. The missile system was designed by the Raduga Design Bureau during the 1970s as a follow up to the P-120 Malakhit (NATO reporting name &quot;SS-N-9 Siren&quot;). The Moskit was originally designed to be ship-launched, but variants have been adapted to be launched from land (modified trucks), underwater (submarines) and air (reportedly the Sukhoi Su-33, a naval variant of the Sukhoi Su-27), as well as on the Lun-class ekranoplan. The missile can carry conventional and nuclear warheads. The exact classification of the missile is unknown, with varying types reported. This uncertainty is due to the secrecy surrounding an active military weapon. The missile has been purchased and exported to the People's Liberation Army Navy (China) and Indian Navy (India)
         
It reaches a speed of Mach 3 (3,675 km/h; 2,284 mph) at high altitude and Mach 2.2 at low-altitude. This speed is 4.25 to 3 times more than speed of the subsonic American Harpoon. The Moskit was designed to be employed against smaller NATO naval groups in the Baltic Sea (Danish and German) and the Black Sea (Turkish) and non-NATO vessels in the Pacific (Japanese, South Korean, etc.), and to defend the Russian mainland against NATO amphibious assault. The missile can perform intensive anti-defense maneuvers with overloads in excess of 10g, which completed for 9 km before the target.
        
Variants of the missile have been designated 3M80M, 3M82 (Moskit M). The P-270 designation is believed to be the initial product codename for the class of missile, with the Russian Ministry of Defense GRAU indices (starting with 3M) designating the exact variant of the missile. The 3M80 was its original model. The 3M80M model (also termed 3M80E for export) was a 1984 longer range version of the missile, with the latest version with the longest range being the 3M82 Moskit M. The ASM-MSS / Kh-41 variant is the 1993 air-launched version of the missile.
        
The 3M80MVE variant has an optional longer 240 km range through a second, high-altitude flight profile setting, however using the higher altitude profile would make the missile detectable at much greater distances.

The Matra BAe Dynamics (MBD) Storm Shadow missile system has been selected for the RAF to meet SR (A) 1236, the Conventionally Armed Stand Off Missile (CASOM). The contract was awarded to MBD in February 1997 after an international competition with six other companies. The Storm Shadow missile
system proposed by MBD is based on the flight-proven Apache air vehicle, and is optimised to meet UK requirements.
                
Storm Shadow is an air-launched, conventionally-armed, long-range, stand-off, precision weapon, which is deployable at night or day, in most weather and operational conditions. It is being developed to attack and destroy a wide spectrum of static, high value targets as listed below:
C3 (Command, Control and Communication) facilities, airfield facilities, port facilities, ASM/ammo
storage, ships/submarines in port, bridges.
                
Storm Shadow will be integrated onto Tornado GR4/4A, Harrier GR/9 and Eurofighter. It will be capable of employment in all theatres of conflict, and the warhead is optimised for use against hardened targets. The Storm Shadow missile requirement embodies the following key features:
-Fire and forget, with fully autonomous guidance
-All up round [ensures high system readiness]
                
The Storm Shadow weapon system comprises:
The operational missile and its All Up Round Container (AURC)
Mission Planning Infrastructure
Data Programming System
the Ground/Air Training missile (GATM) and its AURC.
The Storm Shadow missile is derived from the Apache Anti Runway missile. Key elements of this proven technology have been retained for Storm Shadow, but the following major modifications are being introduced to meet the particular Storm Shadow requirements:
new guidance and navigation based on TERPROM [TERrain PROfile Matching] terrain navigation with an
integrated GPS; terminal guidance using imaging infra-red sensor and autonomous target recognition system;
the high lethality of the system is achieved by the use of a BROACH [Bomb Royal Ordnance Augmented Charge]
unitary warhead.
                     
The missile weighs approximately 1,300 kilograms and is just over five metres long. Its maximum diameter is under one metre, and with its wings deployed, under three metres.
The first phase of the mission planning regime ensures that the missile navigates to the target with maximum survivability and then enters a robust target acquisition and terminal guidance phase. For complex and predetermined missions, much of this data would have been pre-prepared earlier at the Command Headquarters.
Following an Air Tasking Order, the Squadron would prepare the mission data file with the pre-planned data, together with the latest operational intelligence.
On approaching the terminal phase, the missile will initiate a bunt manoeuvre, pre-selected during mission planning, to obtain the best combination of acquisition probability and lethality against the target. As the missile climbs, it will jettison its nose cover, thereby enabling the missile high resolution imaging infra-red sensor to view
the target area ahead.
                         
The missile&apos;s image processor will compare the actual image features with a reference set of features, determined during mission planning. When a feature match is achieved the target will be acquired and the required aim point selection tracked and used as the reference for the missile terminal guidance.
As the missile closes in on the target the acquisition process will be repeated with a higher resolution data set to refine the aim point. Tracking will continue against this refined aim point until the precise target location is identified.
When engaging hard targets, such as Hardened Aircraft Shelters or bunkers, the missile will strike the target at the
estimated optimum dive angle, selected during mission planning. On impact the detonation sequence commences.
The precursor charge will perforate the target structure, and any soil covering, and the follow through penetrator warhead will continue to penetrate inside the target to be detonated after a pre-selectable fuse delay.
Should the mission be against a target with potential high collateral damage, the mission will be aborted if the target identification and acquisition process is unsuccessful. In this case the missile will fly to a predetermined crash site.
The programme value is for £981 million.
         
The contract for the development and production of Storm Shadow was placed with Matra BAe Dynamics (UK) Ltd in February 1997 after a competitive tender exercise. This was one of the first contracts to be placed with this
contractor. Matra BAe Dynamics (UK) Ltd is a subsidiary of Matra BAe Dynamics SAS, a company jointly owned by BAe plc and Lagardere SCA.
                
Matra BAe Dynamics (France) Ltd has won the SCALP EG contract from the French Government. SCALP EG is the same weapon as Storm Shadow apart from national aspects related to both countries.
                
The MBDA Apache is a French-developed air-launched anti-runway cruise missile, manufactured by European arms company MBDA. The Apache system is at the base of the SCALP EG concept, notably for the aerodynamics and the stealth feature.
The SCALP EG also has a different propulsion system as well as a different warhead. While the SCALP uses a single high-penetration warhead, the Apache&apos;s effect is obtained by dispersal of 10 cluster submunitions.

The Straight Flush provides fire control and guidance for the SA-6 SAM system. The system took the Israeli Air Force by surprise when it was first used in combat by the Egyptians during the 1973 Arab-Israeli War. Israeli aircraft weren&apos;t equipped with radar warning systems capable of detecting Straight Flush radar emissions, and several were shot down. The Israelis quickly reprogrammed their radar warning receivers (RWRs), changed tactics and identified the Straight Flush as the weak point of the system. SA-6 batteries are normally organized with one Straight Flush to four triple-rack launcher vehicles. The Israelis concentrated on taking out the Straight Flush radar first, leaving the launcher vehicles unable to fire.

Su-7B &quot;Fitter-A&quot;: In December 1949, the Soviet dictator Josef Stalin ordered that Pavel Sukhoi and about half of the team of his design bureau should be subordinated to the Tupolev bureau as a means of providing the latter with additional design capability at a time when it was overburdened, but Sukhoi himself was allowed to continue basic research and collaborated with the TsAGI (Central Aerodynamics and Hydrodynamics Institute) in the development of two basic design concepts. These were both tailed types, one based on a conventional wing swept at 60 or 62 degrees (the S type), and the other on a delta wing swept at 57 or 60 degrees (the T type).
Designs to meet the Soviet Air Force&apos;s requirement were drawn up by the Mikoyan-Gurevich and Sukhoi bureaus, the former offering the I-380 that was broadly similar to the Sukhoi design in configuration and powerplant. Sukhoi&apos;s response to the requirement was based on his team&apos;s experience with the experimental configurations mentioned above, and the basic S-1 was accordingly evolved into a more advanced form with an area-ruled airframe incorporating flying surfaces, characterized by a leading-edge sweep angle of 62 degrees, slab tailplane halves, artificial feel in the powered control surfaces, four air brakes on the rear fuselage, an improved wing with kinked trailing edges for greater area, a less tapered nose providing a larger inlet for greater airflow in combination with suck-in auxiliary doors, a translating inlet centerbody containing the antenna for the SRD-5 intercept radar, a clamshell cockpit canopy, a ribbon-type brake chute in a box under the rear fuselage, an armament of two 30 mm cannons supplemented by 32 spin-stabilized unguided rockets carried in an extendable ventral pack, and an internal fuel capacity of 776.7 U.S. gal (646.7 Imp gal; 2,940 liters) that could be supplemented by two 158.5 U.S. gal (132 Imp gal; 600 liter) drop tanks carried on underfuselage hardpoints flanking the extendable rocket pack.
The type was tested and evaluated in the form of some 20 S-2 prototypes and S-22 development aircraft, and in 1958 (probably during January), the Sukhoi type was ordered in preference to the competing Mikoyan-Gurevich I-3U (previously the I-380). Soon after the type had entered production it was decided that the Su-7B, as the type had now been designated, would be better employed as an attack fighter rather than as a pure fighter. It was therefore in this revised role that the new warplane entered service in 1959, with a powerplant of one Lyul&apos;ka AL-7F turbojet rated at 19,841 lb st (88.26 kN) with afterburner. This was a potent but also very thirsty engine that required the use of drop tanks on at least two of this initial variant&apos;s hardpoints (increased in number to four by the addition of one under each wing) to secure even the minimum acceptable radius. The type was produced in several sub variants distinguishable by differences in the position of the nose-mounted instrument boom and by the addition of cable/fuel pipe fairings on the fuselage sides between the main avionics bay and the tail unit. At an early stage, provision was made for two SPRD-110 solid-propellant RATO units on the lower sides of the rear fuselage to reduce the take-off run, and there followed at least twelve variants, not all of them identified.
Su-7BKL &quot;Fitter-A&quot;: This version was optimized for operation from poor airfields by the adoption of a redesigned landing gear with longer-stroke main units of the levered suspension type, as well as low-pressure tires (requiring bulged doors over the nose unit), a steel skid outboard of each main wheel, more efficient brakes, and twin brake chutes.
Su-7BM &quot;Fitter-A&quot;: This is a Su-7B derivative with the AL-7F-1 turbojet rated at 22,046 lb st (98.07 kN) with afterburner, a relocated instrument boom whose added yaw/pitch vanes indicated the introduction of a more sophisticated fire-control system with a ballistic computer, twin ducts above the central fuselage, a KS-4 ejector seat, and a cannon of higher muzzle velocity.
Su-7U &quot;Moujik&quot;: This is the two-seat operational conversion trainer variant of the Su-7B.
Su-7UM &quot;Moujik&quot;: This is the two-seat operational conversion trainer variant of the Su-7BM.
Su-7UMK &quot;Moujik&quot;: This is the two-seat operational conversion trainer variant of the Su-7BMK.

The Sukhoi Su-15 &quot;Flagon&quot; all-weather interceptor was withdrawn from Russian service in about 1992. Although the aircraft was built in the 1950s, it remained a formidable aircraft with several upgrades, and was built in large numbers. Its speed is in excess of Mach 2.4 and it carries large missiles on the outboard portion of the wings.
The aircraft&apos;s wings are mid-mounted delta with square tips. There are two turbojets in the fuselage and two exhausts. The fuselage is rectangular from the air intakes to the tail. The nose is bullet-shaped and has a bubble canopy. The tail is swept-back and has a tapered fin with a square tip. The flats are swept-back, tapered, and mid-mounted on the fuselage.

The Su-17/20/22 family are progressive developments of the fixed wing Su-7 known as the Fitter. Su-20 and later -22 are known to be export versions of the Su-17. The Su-17 was in production for more than 20 years and declined in many versions: Su-17M, Su-17M2, Su-17M3, Su-17M4 (low altitude subsonic bomber), Su-17UM (trainer),... The Su-17 remains an effective aircraft with capable avionics and impressive armament although lacking range due to high fuel usage and lower internal capacity, but it can be effective when launched from airfields closer to the FLOT. It was widely used in ex Varsaw pact forces as well in the Middle East and Africa.

The Sukhoi Su-17/20/22 family was a development of the fixed wing Su-7.
This highly manoeuvrable and fast aircraft proved to be a bit of a disappointment due to its inadequate weapon carrying capacity and limited range caused by high fuel consumption by AL-7F engine. These limitations can be summarised by a statement of one of the Indian AF pilots : &quot;it is an impressive aircraft, which can carry quite a lot of bombs and can fly to remote targets, it&apos;s a pity that we can&apos;t do both things at once&quot;.
A requirement for an improved aircraft was issued by Soviet AF High Command and as a response Sukhoi OKB offered modified Su-7 aircraft known as Su-7IG or S-22I. The Sukhoi OKB team decided that the variable sweep wings would improve aircraft&apos;s performance. However, a full sweep wings could not be used without radical modifications to the fuselage. Therefore, the wing sweep point was moved to nearly half span position and fixed part of a wing was equipped with large aerodynamic fences. Flaps were fitted to both fixed and variable parts of the wing, while leading edge slats only to variable sections. These changes increased the weight of the aircraft by 400 kg, however, the first test flight proved that the modified aircraft has much better performance than its predecessor. Take off and landing improved considerably as did range, weapon load and manoeuvrability. The next improved prototype S-32, which included some technological changes and improved internal installations was introduced into production as Su-17.
External changes included a dorsal spine fairing, clamshell canopy which replaced Su7&apos;s sliding canopy, and slightly bigger fuselage diameter. This version was produced between 1970-72 and then replaced by Su-17M (Fitter C) featuring a new generation engine AL-21F3. The weapon load was increased from 3000 kg to 4000 kg (two additional hardpoinst were mounted under the fuselage) and range increased by 60 to 80%.
In 1975 a new version was built - Su-17M2 (Fitter D) and was in production until 1979. The aircraft had completely new electronics including laser rangefinder and DISS Doppler radar, which were housed in a longer nose. The Su-17M2D (Fitter F) was essentially identical to Su-17M2, but equipped with R-29BS-300 engine with larger diameter resulting in &quot;fatter&quot; fuselage, and was mainly offered for export as Su-22 with downgraded electronics (delivered to Peru and Libya). In 1976 Sukhoi OKB designed two-seater version of Fitter known as Su-17UM (Fitter E). The redesigned and lowered nose (3o declination) of the aircraft as well as a double cockpit gave the aircraft its characteristic &quot;hunchback&quot; appearance.
The Su-20 with partially downgraded avionics and electronics was exported to Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Egypt, Iraq, North Korea, Poland and Vietnam.

Su-24 &quot;Fencer-B&quot;: This was the first &quot;Fencer&quot; variant to enter full-scale service, an event that took place in 1976. The variant is a revised version of the &quot;Fencer-A&quot; with a bullet fairing at the base of the fin for a larger brake chute, possibly indicating higher operational weights, and a deeply dished bottom to the box enclosing the jetpipes.
Su-24M &quot;Fencer-D&quot;: First flown in 1977 for service from 1983, this variant is similar to the &quot;Fencer-C&quot; but has a terrain-following radar in place of the earlier variants&apos; terrain-avoidance radar, a retractable in-flight refueling probe, provision for a UPAZ &quot;buddy&quot; refueling pack of the HDU type, capable of transferring 19,841 lbs (9,000 kg) of fuel, the nose section lengthened by 2 ft 5.5 in (0.75 m) forward of the cockpit to create an additional avionics bay aft of the radome, large wing fences with extended wing glove pylons for the Kh-29 (AS-14 &quot;Kedge&quot;) ASM, the undernose antennae removed to leave just a single nose probe with yaw/pitch vanes, and a Laser Rangefinder &amp; Marked Target Seeker (LRMTS) in a windowed blister fairing under the fuselage aft of the nosewheel unit. The export version of the Su-24M is the Su-24MK &quot;Fitter-D&quot;. It differs from the &quot;Fencer-C&quot; in details such as its maximum disposable load of 17,637 lbs (8,000 kg), its maximum take-off weight of 87,522 lbs (39,700 kg), and its radius of 565 nm (650 miles; 1,050 km) on a hi-lo-hi attack mission with a warload of 6,614 lbs (3,000 kg) and two drop tanks.
Su-24MR &quot;Fencer-E&quot;: This is the reconnaissance and EW variant designed to supplant the Yak-28 &quot;Brewer-E&quot; in the escort and stand-off roles. The type entered service in the summer of 1985, and in its standard form carries on the underfuselage centerline hardpoint a circular-section pod some 19 ft 8.25 in (6.0 m) long. It can be replaced by a flat-sided (presumably SLAR) pod some 13 ft 1.5 in (4.0 m) long. The variant has no overwing fences, a shorter nose radome, flush dielectric panels on the side of the nose, a domed air inlet for a heat exchanger above the central fuselage, and a &quot;hockey stick&quot; antenna under each inlet. The Su-24MR generally operates with a drop tank on each inner underwing hardpoint and a small equipment pod on the starboard outer underwing hardpoint.

The Su-25 Grach (NATO designation &quot;Frogfoot&quot;) is the Soviet bloc&apos;s heavy hitter against ground targets. First seen in action over Afghanistan in 1982, it became fully operational by 1984. The Su-25 employs the same low-flying tactics as the A-10 (its U.S. counterpart) to lose itself in ground clutter and evade hostile aircraft. In air-to-air situations, the Frogfoot is in trouble unless its opponent is another close-support craft. Its air-to-air missiles give it an edge against attack helicopters and other low-and-slow aircraft, but a careful fighter pilot in any kind of dogfighting machine would make short work of a Su-25. The Frogfoot flies in the air forces of Russia and Iraq; it is also in the inventories of several other nations.

The Su-27 is a dedicated interceptor and air-to-air fighter. Using fly-by-wire (FBW) controls and with leading-edge root extensions (LERX), the Su-27 is easily the most maneuverable Soviet fighter. Its sensory equipment includes state-of-the-art look-down/shoot-down radar with a 150-mile range, infrared search and track systems, a laser rangefinder and radar warning receivers. It also boasts a helmet-mounted aiming system, thus further enhancing the pilot&apos;s ability to hit his targets. The Flanker&apos;s standard weapon load includes no less than 10 air-to-air missiles of the latest design, some with beyond visual range (BVR) locking and tracking. This aircraft is extremely deadly in the hands of a skilled pilot. Its speed, radar, and weapons range allow it both &quot;first look&quot; and &quot;first fire&quot; over almost every other aircraft in the sky.

In 1980, the Sukhoi Design Bureau developed the conceptual design of the Su-27 combat trainer version (dubbed the T-10U in the SDB). Its special feature is the capability to perform all the combat missions of the basic Su-27. The Su-27&apos;s nose fuselage configuration was changed: The instructor&apos;s station located under the same canopy as the trainee pilot&apos;s station in the front cockpit was elevated to ensure better forward and downward view. The two-seater has a 0.5% increased wing section thickness ratio and the fins are 425 mm higher. Additionally, the oxygen system capacity was increased and the air conditioning and control systems were optimised. In spite of the inevitable increase in drag and aircraft weight, the UB&apos;s characteristics are practically the same as those of the Su-27.

Based on the two-seat Su-27UB trainer and originally known as the Su-27PU, the Sukhoi Su-30 is intended to be a long-range precision-attack fighter similar in mission to the F-15E Strike Eagle. While retaining the Air-to-Air interceptor duties of the Su-27, the early Su-30 and Su-30K models are optimized for long-endurance missions of 10 hours or so. These aircraft are also fitted with a radiolocation system that allows them to transmit the positions of up to 10 targets to four other aircraft simultaneously. This feature makes the Su-30 suitable for use as a tactical fighter leader, designating targets to be attacked by other aircraft. These variants were later joined by the multi-role Su-30M model that adds precision ground attack capability and the ability to carry a wide range of advanced guided bombs and missiles. Sukhoi has also actively marketed an export model, the Su-30MK, which has been purchased by India (Su-30MKI) and China (Su-30MKK). India has ordered 28 baseline aircraft and another 12 with canards and vectored thrust nozzles for improved maneuverability. India plans to add these upgrades to its entire Su-30 fleet in the future. Indonesia has also reportedly shown great interest in the Su-30MK, but any acquisition plans have been postponed indefinitely in light of the nation&apos;s recent political and economic turmoil. In Russian service, the Su-30 has supplemented and replaced many older MiG-31 and Su-27 interceptors.

As a result of the 7th session of the Russian-Chinese commission on economic cooperation held in Beijing in August 1999, the two countries reached a general agreement on the deliveries to China of the Su-30MKK two-seat multipurpose fighters, worth a total of about two billion dollars. Under the agreement, Russia will start delivery of about 40 jets to China between 2000 and 2002. The Sukhoi Design Bureau developed the state-of-the-art Su-30MKK (modernized, commercial for China) for the specific requirements of the Chinese military.
This Su-30 variant is capable of carrying twice the payload of a baseline Su-27. It can carry the most modern russian air-to-air missiles, including the AA-11 Archer and AA-12 Adder. The Su-30MMK is the export version for China.

The Sukhoi Su-34 (export designation: Su-32 Platypus, NATO reporting name: Fullback) is a Russian twin-seat fighter-bomber. It is intended to replace the Sukhoi Su-24.Based on the Su-27 Flanker, it is intended for high-precision strikes, including strikes with nuclear weapons, on land and sea targets at any time of day.
                
In 1990 Based on the SU-27 a dedicated strike version was developed - first designated the T10B/SU-27IB (IB for Istrebitel-Bombardirovshchik - fighter bomber) The aircraft made its maiden flight on 13 April 1990 piloted by Anatoli Ivanov. The first production version, redesignated the T10V/SU-34, first flew on 18Dec 1993 and a further developed maritime strike/ASW version, designated the T10V/SU-32FN, made its first flight on 28 December 1994 piloted by Igor Votintsev and Evgeny Reunov. Of all the derivatives of the SU-27 this version is by far the most radically changed. It features a new side-by-side two seat 17 mm titanium armoured EFIS cockpit with 7 liquid crystal displays(LCD), 2 Zvezda K-36DM ejector seats

The Sukhoi Su-35 (NATO designation: Flanker-E) is a 4.5 generation heavy class, long-range, multi-role, air superiority fighter and strike fighter. Due to the similar features and components it contains, the Sukhoi Su-35 is considered to be a close cousin of the Sukhoi Su-30MKI,a specialized version of the Sukhoi Su-35. It has been further developed into the Su-35BM. The Su-35 is in service in small numbers with the Russian Air Force with around five in service.
                
The experimental T10-24 was built in 1985. Flight tests took place in 1988. The first prototype was publicly displayed in 1992 at the Farnborough Air Show. Eleven prototypes were built through 1994, with service slated for 1995. Subsequently, the first test flights of an improved Su-35, the Su-37 &quot;Flanker-F&quot;, in 1996 and the transfer of existing Su-35 prototypes to this program appeared to suggest the end of the Su-35 development. Instead, the Su-37 aircraft were eventually reconverted to Su-35s. The Su-35 is now in production for the Russian Air Force and was recently presented at the MAKS-2007 International Aviation and Space Salon in August 2007.
                
The Su-35 shares larger wings and more powerful engines with the naval variant of the Su-27 and later the Su-30, the Su-33 &quot;Flanker-D&quot;. Other changes from the Su-27 and Su-30 were canards, a larger nose, the greater use of carbon fibre and aluminium-lithium alloy in the airframe, along with larger, &quot;square-off&quot; tail fins. The new nose holds an improved passive electronically scanned array radar and the aircraft featured many other upgrades to its avionics and electronic systems, including digital fly-by-wire and a rear-looking radar for firing Semi-Active Radar missiles.
                
A two-dimensional asymmetric thrust vectoring system was tested on the Su-35 and seems to be the basis for the development of the Su-37 &quot;Flanker-F&quot;. A new type of 2D thrust vectoring engine, the 117S, has been developed and replaces the current AL-35 or AL-31F. The average output of the Su-35 Radar is 5 kW and a peak output of 20 kW.

The Sukhoi Su-37 (NATO designation: &quot;Flanker-F&quot;) is a Russian multi-role jet fighter aircraft. It is a single seat all-weather fighter derived from the Su-27 &quot;Flanker&quot;.
                
The Su-37 is a single-seat, all-weather, fighter and ground attack prototype aircraft, derived from the Su-27 &apos;Flanker&apos;. The Su-27 is a Russian fourth generation jet aircraft that has been exported to over 20 nations. The Su-37 test aircraft made its maiden flight in April 1996 from the Zhukovsky flight testing center near Moscow.
                
The Su-37 includes several updates over the Su-27, including all-weather multi-mode passive electronically scanned array radar with synthetic aperture, terrain avoidance, terrain mapping and a rear-facing radar. The airframe includes a percentage of parts made from composites, unlike the all-metal Su-27. Additionally, the Su-37 incorporates the AL-37FU engines equipped with thrust vectoring. The Su-37&apos;s nozzles are variable in pitch only and travel plus or minus 15 degrees, but they can be operated differentially to provide a rolling moment.
                
In the cockpit the aircraft is the first Russian fighter with the Hands On Throttle and Stick, or HOTAS, system and the first with side-stick. The weapon system shares much with the Su-30&quot;MK&quot;, but it lacks the large display in the rear cockpit occupied by the weapons system officer. The cockpit features four multi-function displays (MFDs) instead of traditional dial-type analogue instruments and has an ejection seat inclined 30 degrees backwards to help counter the effects of high g-forces. The two-grip flying control configuration was designed to prevent the pilot from flailing around when the aircraft engaged in fast vectored-thrust manoeuvres. Both the fixed throttle and the side-stick controller provide secure points for the pilot to brace his hands.
                
The engine not only incorporates a new generation 2D TVC but also is tough and resistant to engine surge even during classic, inverted and flat spins, giving better reliability and maneuverability, such as when the AOA is as high as 180 degrees.
                
The Su-37 appeared at the 1996 Farnborough air show piloted by Sukhoi test pilot Eugeny Frolov. During the performance, the Su-37 was flipped on its back while flying at 350 km/h (217 mph) so that it faced the opposite direction, inverted and almost stationary. After pausing for two seconds the thrust vectoring was used to complete a 360 degree rotation and the aircraft moved off in its original direction of flight at only 60 km/h (37 mph).
                
The Su-37 can carry air-to-air and air-to-surface weapons on 12 stations. The number of missiles and bombs carried can be increased to 14 with the use of multi-payload racks.
                
Russia has not ordered Su-37s, but it might find customers abroad, a market that now constitutes a sizable share of Sukhoi&apos;s income. Several prototypes have been built, but the aircraft is not in production.

This is a strike/attack aircraft that is an upgrade of the Su-25. It carries AA-11 missiles and most of the newer Russian A-G weapons.
&quot;Frogfoot&quot; was used to indicate the new Su-25T, a one-seat ground attack variant from the Su-25UB. Only a few are in service in Russia.
                
Multirole attack aircraft SU-39 is rebuilt modern version of SU-25 &quot;Frogfoot&quot; attack aircraft, featuring large combat payload, good low flying maneuverability and opportunity to dodge enemy air defense systems. It recommended oneself as easy to pilot and maintain, cheap and reliable aircraft. It&apos;s serial production began in 1996.
The Su-39 capability to perform take-off and landing with a combat payload on poorly prepared earth runways, including those located in the mountains up to 3 000 m high at sea level and up to 1 200 meters long, thereby making the Su-39 appropriate for combat use in close vicinity to combat actions region ensuring a rapid change of aircraft basing and the rapid delivery surprise blows on the enemy.The Su-39 is cheapest and effective attack aircraft of its type. Furthermore it is most undemanding. It can use diesel fuel instead of kerosene and does not require high-skilled maintenance. Pilots of any grade can muster the aircraft. The aircraft boasts a 30 year service life, involving routine repairs of an air frame and engine at home aerodromes.
A group of SU-39 partly armed with &quot;air-to-air&quot; class middle range missiles can operate successfully in missile combat to any modern fighters especially if SU-39 use new RVE-DE missiles which doesn&apos;t require escorting for targets illumination laser or infrared. This factor may determine air combat.

First built in 1950, the T-55 is one of the most common tanks on the battlefield, with more than 70,000 built in multiple variants. This tank has a relatively low silhouette, is very inexpensive and is simple to operate. Many nations owning this tank continue to upgrade it. While this tank was impressive in its day, the T-55 has a number of significant shortcomings. The crew quarters are cramped, which reduces overall performance. Furthermore, its main gun and armor have been outclassed by those of more modern tanks.
                
The T-54 and T-55 tanks are a series of Soviet main battle tanks introduced in the years following the Second World War. The first T-54 prototype was completed at Nizhny Tagil by the end of 1945.[2] Initial production ramp up settled for 1947 at Nizhny Tagil, and 1948 for Kharkiv were halted and curtailed as many problems were uncovered; the T-34-85 still accounted for 88 percent of production through the 1950s. The T-54 eventually became the main tank for armoured units of the Soviet Army, armies of the Warsaw Pact countries, and many others. T-54s and T-55s have been involved in many of the world&apos;s armed conflicts since the later part of the 20th century.
                
The T-54/55 series eventually became the most-produced tank in military history. Estimated production numbers for the series range from 86,000 to 100,000. They were replaced by the T-62, T-64, T-72, T-80 and T-90 tanks in the Soviet and Russian armies, but remain in use by up to 50 other armies worldwide, some having received sophisticated retrofitting.
                
During the Cold War, Soviet tanks never directly faced their NATO adversaries in combat in Europe. However, the T-54/55&apos;s first appearance in the West around the period of the 1950s (then the beginning of the Cold War) spurred the United Kingdom to develop a new tank gun, the Royal Ordnance L7, and the United States to develop the M60 Patton.

The successor to the T-55, the T-62 boasts a number of improvements over its predecessor. It has a considerably better traveling range than the T-55, and its 115mm main gun is highly accurate up to 1,100 yds. In addition, it comes equipped with an anti-aircraft machine gun found only on some versions of the T-55. Despite these advantages, the T-62 has several failings. This tank is more complex than the T-55, which makes it more prone to mechanical problems and less reliable. Most importantly, the T-62 has a poor combat record, as was demonstrated in the Gulf War, in which Iraqi T-62s were decisively outclassed by the American M-1A1 Abrams.
                
The T-62 is a Soviet main battle tank that was first introduced 1961. As a further development of the T-55 series, the T-62 retained many similar design elements of its predecessor including low profile and thick turret armor. In contrast with previous tanks, which were armed with rifled tank guns, the T-62 was the first tank armed with a smoothbore tank gun that could fire APFSDS rounds at higher velocities. While the T-62 became the standard tank in the Soviet arsenal, it did not fully replace the T-55 in export markets due to its higher manufacturing costs and maintenance requirements compared to its predecessor. Although the T-62 was replaced in Russia and the successor states of the Soviet Union, it is still used in some countries and its design features became standardized in subsequent Soviet and Russian mass-produced tanks.
                
The T-62 shares some of the T-55&apos;s limitations: a cramped crew compartment, limited depression of the main gun and vulnerable fuel and ammunition storage areas. Opening the ejection port under NBC (nuclear, biological, or chemical) conditions would expose the crew to contamination.
                
Each time the gun is fired, the tube must go into dtente for cartridge ejection; though the system can be deactivated making this unnecessary or in case of facing a NBC environment. The T-62 maximum average rate of fire is limited to 8 rounds per minute, which falls behind the capabilities of Western 105 mm gun equipped tanks.
                
It takes 20 seconds for the T-62&apos;s turret to rotate through a full 360°, which is 5 seconds longer than the time needed by the US M60A1 Patton tank.
                
The turret also cannot be traversed with the driver&apos;s hatch open. Although the tank commander may override the gunner and traverse the turret, he cannot fire the main gun from his position. He is also unable to override the gunner in the elevation of the main gun, causing target acquisition problems.
                
The US Army considered the T-62&apos;s gun more accurate than that of the M60A1 within 1500 meters, but less accurate at greater ranges.
                
To fire the 12.7 mm antiaircraft heavy machine gun, the loader must be partially exposed, making him vulnerable to suppressive fire, and he must leave his main gun loading duties unattended.
                
According to military author Bryan Perrett, the T-62 never enjoyed the commercial success of the T-54/T-55 series for numerous reasons. First, the T-62 was more than twice the price of the T-55, and many Warsaw Pact nations passed on the new tank because they did not feel that the improvements inherent in it warranted the cost. Secondly, in 1968, a 100 mm HVAPDS tank shell capable of piercing Western armor was developed. Use of this shell made the T-55 gun almost as effective as the T-62s, undercutting the T-62&apos;s original selling point: a bigger, more powerful gun. Third, the T-62 was, according to Perrett, almost immediately surpassed on its introduction by the new Western MBTs, the Chieftain and M60. Finally, the T-62 could not keep up with the new Soviet BMP-1 the principal infantry fighting vehicle that the T-62 was supposed to accompany. All of these factors combined to ensure that long term investment in the T-62 was not viable and a new Soviet MBT had to be developed.

Unlike previous Soviet-designed and built tanks, the T-72 is equipped with a standard dozer plow that can be used to clear obstructions or help create firing positions for infantry. It can also bring to bear a large 125mm gun, which is capable of firing a variety of munitions. This tank can also be fitted with mine-clearing equipment.
                
The T-72 is a family of Soviet main battle tanks that first entered production in 1971. About 20,000 T-72 tanks were built, making it one of the most widely produced post-World War II tanks, second only to the T-54/55 family. The T-72A version introduced in 1979 is considered a second-generation main battle tank. It was widely exported and saw service in 40 countries and in numerous conflicts. The T-72B3 version introduced in 2010 is considered a third-generation main battle tank.
                
Because of the time-consuming construction of the 5TDF engines, which took about twice as long as the contemporary V-45, the Malyshev Factory in Kharkiv could not provide a sufficient number of 5TDF engines for all Soviet tank factories.[16] This led to efforts at Uralvagonzavod to design a version of the T-64 with the cheaper and much more reliable V-45 engine of 780 hp. This model was only to be serially produced in the event of a war, a so-called &quot;mobilization model&quot;.
                
In 1967, the Uralvagonzavod formed &quot;Section 520&quot;, which was to prepare the serial production of the T-64 for 1970. The team soon found out that the more powerful V-45 engine put a lot of stress on the T-64 hull, so that after some time cracks started to materialize. A more stable solution was sought.
                
Finally, an idea from 1960 was used, when a modification of the T-62 had been discussed: In 1961, two prototypes of &quot;Object 167&quot; had been built by Uralvagonzavod to test a stronger hull and running gear combination for that tank. Under influence from Kharkiv, the idea had been turned down by Moscow. But this construction, with its big, rubbercoated roadwheels now formed the basis for the mobilisation model of the T-64.
                
Additional changes were made to the automatic loading system, which also was taken from an earlier project, originally intended for a T-62 upgrade. The 125 mm ammunition, consisting of a separate projectile and a propellant charge, was now stored horizontally on two levels, not vertically on one level as in the T-64. It was said to be more reliable than the T-64 autoloader. In 1964, two 125-mm guns of the D-81 type had been used to evaluate their installation in to the T-62, so the Ural plant was ready to adopt the 125 mm calibre for the T-64A as well.

The T-80 is a third-generation main battle tank (MBT) designed and manufactured in the Soviet Union. When it entered service in 1976, it was the first MBT in the world to feature a powerful multifuel turbine engine as its main propulsion engine. The T-80U was last produced in a factory in Omsk, Russia, while the T-80UD and further-developed T-84 continue to be produced in Ukraine. The T-80 and its variants are in service in Belarus, Cyprus, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Russia, South Korea, and Ukraine. The chief designer of the T-80 was the Russian engineer Nikolay Popov.
                
Like the American M-1A1, the T-80 is equipped with a turbine engine capable of producing great speed and power. Another improvement that it boasts over previous Soviet tanks is its laminated armor. This new protection makes the T-80 extremely resistant to infantry-launched anti-tank weapons. Additionally, this tank comes equipped with a dozer blade and can be easily fitted for minesweeping duties.
                
The T-80 is similar in layout to the T-64; the driver&apos;s compartment is on the centre line at the front, the two-man turret is in the centre with the gunner on the left and the commander on the right, and the engine is rear mounted. Overall, its shape is also very similar to the T-64. The original T-80 design uses a 1,000 horsepower gas turbine instead of a 750-horsepower diesel engine, although some later variants of the T-80 reverted to diesel engine usage. The gearbox is different, with five forward and one reverse gear, instead of seven forward and one reverse. Suspension reverts from pneumatic to torsion bar, with six forged steel-aluminium rubber-tyred road wheels on each side, with the tracks driven by rear sprockets. The glacis is of laminate armour and the turret is armoured steel. The turret houses the same 125 mm 2A46 smoothbore gun as the T-72, which can fire anti-tank guided missiles as well as regular ordnance. The tracks are slightly wider and longer than on the T-64 giving lower ground pressure.
                
The main gun is fed by the Korzina automatic loader. This holds up to 28 rounds of two-part ammunition in a carousel located under the turret floor. Additional ammunition is stored within the turret. The ammunition comprises the projectile (APFSDS, HEAT or HE-Frag) plus the propellant charge, or the two-part missile. The autoloader is an effective, reliable, combat tested system that has been in use since the mid-1960s. The propellant charge is held inside a semi-combustible cartridge case made of a highly flammable material, this is consumed in the breech during firing, except for a small metal baseplate.
                
A disadvantage highlighted during combat in Chechnya was the vulnerability of the T-80BV to catastrophic explosion. The reason given by US and Russian experts is the vulnerability of stored semi-combustible propellant charges and missiles when contacted by the molten metal jet from the penetration of a HEAT warhead, causing the entire ammunition load to explode. This vulnerability may be addressed in later models. When Western tank designs changed from non-combustible propellant cartridges to semi-combustible, they tended to separate ammunition stowage from the crew compartment with armoured blast doors, and provided &apos;blow-out&apos; panels to redirect the force and fire of exploding ammunition away from the crew compartment.
                
The autoloader takes between 7.1 and 19.5 seconds to load the main weapon (28 rounds), depending on the initial position of autoloader carousel.
                
The T-80&apos;s armour is composite on the turret and hull, while rubber flaps and sideskirts protect the sides and lower hull. The later T-80 models use explosive reactive armour and stronger armour, like the T-80U and T-80UM1. Other protection systems include the Shtora-1 and Arena APS, as well as the discontinued Drozd APS.
                
The latest T-80 variant in service, the T-84 Oplot, has an entirely new turret with an armoured ammunition compartment to help prevent accidental detonation.

The T-90 is derived from the T-72. It upgrades virtually every system from it&apos;s ancestor. Still, the T-90 is of conventional design. It has the classical low silhouette of the earlier russian tanks. The rounded turret is centered on the hull. The combination of active and passive defenses of the T-90 turn it into one of the worlds best protected tanks.
                
The T-90&apos;s AT-11 Sniper laser-guided ATGM can engage other vehicles and low-flying helicopters upto 4000m, giving the T-90 a decisive range advantage. The TShU-1-7 Shtora-1 optronic counter measures system enables the T-90 to disrupt enemy laser guidance for incomming ATGMs.
                
There are at least another three different variants of the T-90: An export version with varying motorization and equipment, the T-90S and the T-90SK, which is a commando variant. There are also rumors about a T-90E.

Admiral Flota Sovetskogo Soyuza Kuznetsov &quot;Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union Kuznetsov&quot;) is an aircraft cruiser (heavy aircraft-carrying missile cruiser, or TAVKR, in Russian classification) serving as the flagship of the Russian Navy. She was built by the Black Sea Shipyard, the sole manufacturer of Soviet aircraft carriers, in Nikolayev within the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. The initial name of the ship was Riga; she was launched as Leonid Brezhnev, embarked on sea trials as Tbilisi, and finally named Admiral Flota Sovetskogo Soyuza Kuznetsov. The ship was named after Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union Nikolay Gerasimovich Kuznetsov.
                
She was originally commissioned in the Soviet Navy, and was intended to be the lead ship of her class. However, her sister ship Varyag had not yet been commissioned when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. The second hull was eventually sold by Ukraine to the People&apos;s Republic of China, completed in Dalian and commissioned as Liaoning.

The Tactical Airborne Reconnaissance Pod System (TARPS) is a large and sophisticated camera pod carried by the F-14 Tomcat. It contains three camera bays with different type cameras which are pointed down at passing terrain. It was originally designed to provide an interim aerial reconnaissance capability until a dedicated F/A-18 Reconnaissance version could be fielded. However, it was pressed into service upon arrival in the fleet and was still in use up to the end of Tomcat service in 2006.

Taurus KEPD 350 is a German/Swedish air-launched cruise missile, manufactured by Taurus Systems and used by Germany, Spain and South Korea. Taurus Systems GmbH is a partnership between MBDA Deutschland GmbH and Saab Bofors Dynamics.
		                	  
The missile incorporates stealth technology and has an official range in excess of 500 km (300 mi).Taurus is powered by a turbofan engine at Mach 1 and can be carried by Tornado, Eurofighter Typhoon, Gripen, F/A-18, and F-15K jets.
             
The double 500-kilogram (1,100 lb) warhead, called Mephisto (Multi-Effect Penetrator HIghly Sophisticated and Target Optimised), features a precharge and initial penetrating charge to clear soil or enter a hardened underground bunker, then a variable delay fuze to control detonation of the main warhead. The missile weighs about 1,400 kg (3,100 lb) and has a maximum body diameter of 1 metre (3.3 ft). Intended targets are hardened bunkers; command, control, and communications facilities; airfield and port facilities; AMS and ammunition storage; ships in port or at sea; and bridges.
             
The missile also includes counter measures as a self-defence mechanism and electronic counter measures.
                  
Mission planners program the missile with the target, air defence locations and planned ground path, then the missile uses a low terrain-hugging flight path guided by INS, IBN, TRN, and GPS to the proximity of the target, although it is capable of navigating over very long distances without GPS support.
Once there the missile commences a bunt (climb) manoeuvre to an altitude intended to achieve the best probability of target acquisition and penetration. During the cruise flight a high resolution thermographic camera (infrared homing) can support the navigation by using IBN and is also used for GPS-free target attack. The missile attempts to match a camera image with the planned 3D target model (DSMAC). If it cannot, it defaults to the other navigation systems, or, if there is a high risk of collateral damage, it will steer to a pre-designated crash point instead of risking an inaccurate attack with undesired consequences.
            
Taurus Systems GmbH has also proposed an anti-ship variant.

Equipped with the Aegis weapons system, the Ticonderoga class cruiser is the world&apos;s most sophisticated anti-air warfare ship. The heart of the Aegis is the AN/SPY-1 phased array radar. The AN/SPY-1 performs all functions necessary to conduct anti-air warfare, from target detection to fire control. The system automatically classifies all contacts and, if desired, can automatically fire on threats. While this level of autonomy increases the chance of friendly-fire kills, human operators could easily become overloaded during an intense anti-ship missile attack. The command and display system is fully integrated with other ship sensors, keeping the ship&apos;s captain apprised of the anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare situations as well.
                
The Ticonderoga class also carries plenty of anti-ship, anti-submarine and land attack weaponry, including Harpoons, Mk-46 torpedoes, ASROCs, 5-inch guns and Tomahawk cruise missiles.

		<DescriptionData>
The Ticonderoga class of guided missile cruisers is a class of warships in the United States Navy, first ordered and authorized in the 1978 fiscal year. The class uses passive phased-array radar and was originally planned as a class of destroyers. However, the increased combat capability offered by the Aegis Combat System and the AN/SPY-1 radar system, together with the capability of operating as a flagship, were used to justify the change of the classification from DDG (guided missile destroyer) to CG (guided-missile cruiser) shortly before the keels were laid down for Ticonderoga and Yorktown.
                
Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruisers are multi-role warships. Their Mk 41 VLS can launch Tomahawk cruise missiles to strike strategic or tactical targets, or fire long-range antiaircraft Standard Missiles for defense against aircraft or anti-ship missiles. Their LAMPS III helicopters and sonar systems allow them to perform antisubmarine missions. Ticonderoga-class ships are designed to be elements of carrier battle groups or amphibious ready groups, as well as performing missions such as interdiction or escort. With upgrades to their to AN/SPY-1 phased radar systems and their associated missile payloads as part of the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System, members of this class have also begun to demonstrate some promise as mobile anti-ballistic missile and anti-satellite weaponry platforms.

Sky Sword (Chinese: Tien Chien) are a series of missile systems developed by the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology in Taiwan for the Republic of China Air Force (ROCAF).
Sky Sword 1 is a short range infrared guided air-to-air missile. The missile has fire and forget slave-by-radar capabilities. It consists of an imaging infrared seeker, a high explosive warhead, a solid propellant motor and a guidance control unit. The seeker uses dual spectral IR and has a detection range of 18.5km. The Sky Sword 1 is also used as a surface-to-air missile by the Antelope air defence system.
Sky Sword 1 (TC-1) missile was developed in the mid-1980s and revealed in May 1986, as Taiwan's first indigenous air-to-air missile. The production of the missile started in 1991 and the air-to-air version entered ROCAF service in 1993. It bears a striking similarity to the American AIM-9 (also in Taiwanese service) and fulfills a similar role on the Indigenous Defense Fighter to the AIM-9 on the F-16. In 2017 NCSIST exhibited a variant of the TC-1 with a larger diameter motor.

Sky Sword II (Tien Chien II) is a medium-range, radar guided air-to-air missile. It has an inertial navigation system, a data-link for mid-course guidance and active radar homing for terminal guidance, beyond visual range. It also has ECCM capability and can engage multiple targets. According to Su Tzu-yun, Chief Executive Officer at the Center for Advanced Technology at Tamkang University, they are a cost-effective design which can perform a key role in Taiwan's defense strategy, and substantially offset Chinas air superiority. Some details of its design were revealed for the first time at the Paris Air Show in 2015. The pulse doppler radar seeker reportedly has a detection range of 9.3km
         
Development of the Sky Sword II (TC-2) family began during the 1990s.
        
In 2017 a Sky Sword II launched by a F-CK-1 during a training exercise failed to ignite and fell into the sea. In 2019 TC-1 and TC-2 models were among 117 missiles fired during a training exercise off Taiwans west coast.

Version of Tornado IDS dedicated to reconnaissance and enemy air defence suppression. ECR = Electronic Combat and Reconnaissance. Only Tornados with RB.199 Mk 105 engines. 35 a/c new-build for Germany, 16 a/c conversions for Italy.
               
Tornado ECR
Operated by Germany and Italy, the ECR (Electric Combat / Reconnaissance) is a Tornado variant devoted to Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) missions. It was first delivered on 21 May 1990. The ECR has sensors to detect radar usage and is equipped with anti-radiation AGM-88 HARM missiles. The Luftwaffe's 35 ECRs were delivered new, while Italy received 16 converted IDSs. Italian Tornado ECRs differ from the Luftwaffe aircraft as they lack built-in reconnaissance capability and use RecceLite reconnaissance pods, also only Luftwaffe ECRs are equipped with RB199 Mk.105 engine, which has a slightly higher thrust rating. The German ECRs do not carry a cannon. The RAF uses the IDS version in the SEAD role instead of the ECR. It also modified several of its Tornado F.3s to undertake the mission.

The interceptor version of the basic Tornado is a compromise, but an efficient fighting machine nonetheless. The ADV is slightly longer than its IDS sister to accommodate the Skyflash missiles and the Foxhunter radar. The aircraft has a complex avionics suite allowing advanced target identification and vision-augmentation prior to engagement with the Sky Flash missiles. Not a great dogfighter by any means, the F.3 is a very capable platform for performing CAP duties, which it did successfully during the Gulf war in 1991.

The ground strike version of the basic Tornado. The GR.1 has very sophisticated avionics, allowing low level runs to target either flown by the pilot using his HUD, or by the terrain following radar. The wings sweep automatically to the most efficient configuration, giving an unparalleled combination of speed, ride comfort and fuel economy.The Tornado IDS now comes in four flavours in the RAF service: GR.1, GR.1A (tactical reconnaisance) and GR.1B (maritime attack role, using the BAe Sea Eagle missile.) and updated GR4s.

Tu-16 &quot;Badger-A&quot;: For its period a remarkable warplane, the Tu-16 was built to the extent of some 2,000 aircraft up to 1959, and in mid-1995 it was estimated that some 600 of these aircraft still remained in declining service with the air arms of the CIS (350 of them in the bomber and strike roles, and the other 250 in a number of other roles including reconnaissance and in-flight refueling).
The factor that made this thoroughly modern bomber possible was the design of the Mikulin AM-3 turbojet, a slender axial-flow engine offering high power at a comparatively modest specific fuel consumption. The imminence of this engine opened the way for the Tupolev design bureau to terminate its efforts on some smaller turbojet-powered bombers, so that a major effort could be made for the speedy design and development of the larger Tu-88 type, intended for long-range operations on the power of two AM-3 turbojets.
In the summer of 1950, the bureau was ordered to proceed as rapidly as possible with the construction of three prototypes (one of them for static tests) that were to be evaluated in competition with the smaller Ilyushin Il-46. The fuselage of the Tu-88 was larger than that of previous Tupolev turbojet-powered bombers, but was based on the same design and construction principles, while the wing was altogether more novel, as it was not only larger but of swept configuration and based on a new alloy making the use of comparatively thick skins for great strength possible. Another novelty were the main units of the tricycle landing gear, for these four-wheel units introduced the bogie to Soviet practice and were also designed to retract rearward into large trailing-edge pods that became a trademark of many larger Tupolev aircraft. Mounted in the mid/shoulder-set position, the wing was characterized by a leading-edge sweep of 42 degrees, declining to 35 degrees slightly outboard of the main landing gear units, and carried area-increasing flaps inboard and slotted ailerons outboard. The tail unit was also swept, the vertical surface at 40 degrees and the horizontal surface (tailplane with separate elevators) at 45 degrees.
             
The two engines were installed in large nacelles built integrally with the fuselage center section, which in turn carried the wing. During the Tu-88&apos;s development, these nacelles were revised to an area-ruled configuration and provided with outward-angled jetpipes to reduce asymmetric thrust problems in the event of an engine failure. Fuel for these engines was carried in fuselage fuel cells and integral wing tanks.
Accommodation was provided in two pressurized compartments that were linked by a tunnel only in the prototypes: the forward compartment was occupied by the navigator/bombardier, two pilots, and a radar operator/gunner with an upper-hemisphere sighting dome for the two 23 mm cannons in the dorsal barbette, while the rear compartment was occupied by two more gunners, one in the tail turret with its two 23 mm cannons and the other farther forward with port and starboard sighting positions for the 23 mm cannons in the ventral barbette. The fixed armament was completed by a seventh 23 mm cannon, controlled by the pilot and fixed to fire straight ahead.
Late in 1952, the Tu-88 was selected as a major service type with the designation Tu-16. Considerable development had to be undertaken as the type was initially overweight and lacked adequate performance, but the Tu-16 entered service in 1954 as a conventional strategic bomber with the 19,841 lb (9,000 kg) FAB-9000 free-fall bomb or larger numbers of smaller weapons, and was later allocated the NATO reporting name &quot;Badger-A&quot;.
          
Early aircraft were fitted with Mikulin AM-3 turbojets, each rated at 19,290 lb st (85.81 kN) dry, but later aircraft received the AM-3M engines that increased unrefueled range to 3,885 nm (4,474 miles; 7,200 km) and boosted maximum speed by 54 kts (62 mph; 100 km/h).
Tu-16A &quot;Badger-A&quot;: This was the nuclear strategic bomber counterpart to the Tu-16 conventional bomber, from which it was externally indistinguishable.
Tu-16T &quot;Badger-A&quot;: This was the anti-ship variant of the Tu-16 with provision for two WB-2F guided bombs, or four RAT-52 torpedoes, or four 2,205 lb (1,000 kg) AMD-1000 mines, or twelve 1,102 lb (500 kg) AMD-500 mines.
Tu-16KS-1 &quot;Badger-B&quot;: No longer in service, the Tu-16KS-1 was the Tu-16 variant for the aerial launch and guidance of two KS-1 (AS-1 &quot;Kennel&quot;) anti-ship missiles carried on underwing hardpoints. The type carried a &quot;Komet III&quot; Doppler guidance radar with its antenna in a retractable radome under the central fuselage in line with the engine exhausts, and surviving aircraft were rebuilt to &quot;Badger-G&quot; standard.
The &quot;Puff Ball&quot; radar has a range of some 135 nm (155 miles; 250 km) and is a ground-mapping type able to acquire targets for air-launched missiles or to provide mid-course guidance updates for surface-launched missiles, while the A-329Z radar provides guidance for the KS-10 missile. As the variant became obsolete is its primary role, most surviving aircraft were converted to Tu-16K-26 standard or alternatively adapted for the free-fall bombing role.
Tu-16KCP-5 &quot;Badger-C (Modified)&quot;: This is the variant produced by converting Tu-16KS-10s, made redundant by the obsolescence of their KS-10 missile, to a more modern standard with the semi-recessed missile position under the fuselage faired over (but otherwise retained internally) and two hardpoints added under the wings for KCP-5 (AS-6 &quot;Kingfish&quot;) anti-ship missiles or alternative loads of bombs or mines.
The Tu-16R &quot;Badger-D&quot; has a length of 120 ft 1 in (36.60 m), and its crew is supplemented by two or three mission specialists.
Tu-16R &quot;Badger-E&quot;: This is the Tu-16 &quot;Badger-A&quot; bomber rebuilt for multi-sensor (photographic and electronic) reconnaissance. Though most Badgers have a small camera installation just behind the bay for the retracted nosewheel unit, this type was designed for the strike assessment rather than reconnaissance role, and the dedicated reconnaissance variant carries a specialized camera pallet in the erstwhile weapons bay, together with ELINT receiver antennae in two underfuselage blister radomes immediately forward and aft of the erstwhile weapon bay under the fuselage.
The previous weapons bay may also carry additional fuel, and while the original glazed bombardier nose is retained, the fixed 23 mm cannon is often removed.
Tu-16Kh-? &quot;Badger-G&quot;: This is an advanced anti-ship missile variant produced by converting Tu-16KS-1 aircraft to carry two examples of the more advanced AS-5 &quot;Kelt&quot; anti-ship or stand-off missiles under the wings. The nose is similar to that of the Tu-16KS-1, but the Argon navigation/attack radar&apos;s undernose radome is used for the antenna of the more modern &quot;Short Horn&quot; radar, a more capable equipment designed to acquire ship targets at a range of more than 108 nm (125 miles; 200 km).
The variant has a radius of more than 1,738 nm (2,001 miles; 3,220 km), and retains free-fall bombing capability.
Tu-16KCP-5 &quot;Badger-G (Modified)&quot;: First noted in 1977, this is a variant of the &quot;Badger-G&quot; designed to carry KCP-5 (AS-6 &quot;Kingfish&quot;) rather than AS-5 &quot;Kelt&quot; missiles. Some aircraft retain the &quot;Short Horn&quot; of the &quot;Badger-G&quot; and are perhaps not properly designated Tu-16K-26 &quot;Badger-G (Modified)&quot;, for the full standard has the chin radome removed and a considerably larger radome added just forward of the weapons bay for a new target-acquisition and missile-guidance radar.
Tu-16PP &quot;Badger-J&quot;: This is a dedicated EW variant comparable to the &quot;Badger-H&quot;, but intended for the active support role with improved receiver/analysis and jammer capability (spot, barrage, noise and click types), whose antennae are located inside a shallow canoe fairing under the fuselage.
Tu-16R &quot;Badger-K&quot;: This is a long-range ELINT variant with additional fuel and receiving antennae in two equal-size blister radomes (one forward of the erstwhile weapons bay and the other under the rear of this bay).

The Tupolev Tu-22M is a supersonic, variable-sweep wing, long-range strategic and maritime strike bomber developed by the Tupolev Design Bureau in the 1960s. According to some sources, the bomber was believed to be designated Tu-26 at one time. During the Cold War, the Tu-22M was operated by the Soviet Air Forces (VVS) in a missile carrier strategic bombing role, and by the Soviet Naval Aviation (Aviacija Vojenno-Morskogo Flota, AVMF) in a long-range maritime anti-shipping role. Significant numbers remain in service with the Russian Air Force, and as of 2014 more than 100 Tu-22Ms are in use.
An initial attempt at modernizing the Tu-22M, Adaptation-45.03M, based around modernising the aircraft's radar, began in 1990, but was abandoned before reaching production. In 2007, work began on a new radar for the Tu-22M, the NV-45, which was first flown on a Tu-22M in 2008, with four more repaired Tu-22Ms refitted with NV-45 radars in 20142015.
         
A contract for a full mid-life upgrade, the Tu-22M3M was signed in September 2014. The aircraft is to receive a further modified NV-45M radar, together with new navigation equipment and a modified flight control system. A new self-defense electronic radar suite is fitted, replacing the tail gun of the existing Tu-22M3. Much of the new avionics are shared with the upgraded Tu-160M2. Armament is planned to be enhanced by adding the new Kh-32 missile, a heavily modified version of the current Kh-22, the subsonic Kh-SD, the hypersonic Kh-MT, or the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal missiles.[13][16] Deliveries of the Tu-22M3M are expected to begin in 2021.
          
A separate, simpler, upgrade program (SVP-24-22) is being carried out by the company Gefest and T, based on avionics developed for the Sukhoi Su-24 attack aircraft, including a new computer, a new navigation system and digital processing for the aircraft's radar. The upgrade is claimed to greatly increase navigation accuracy and bomb delivery. A SVP-24-22-equipped Tu-22M underwent trials in 2009, and the program has been ordered into production, with deliveries from 2012.

The Tu-95 &quot;Bear&quot; is a long-range strategic bomber that entered service during the 1950s. Operationally, Bear bombers are normally outfitted as cruise missile platforms, but can perform saturation bombing as well. Several variants have also been produced to fill specialized roles such as naval strike, anti-submarine warfare, reconnaissance and communications relay. The Tu-142 is an upgrade of the Bear, but is similar enough to be considered a variant rather than a new aircraft. The aircraft is currently flown by Russia, the Ukraine and India.The Tu-95&apos;s defenses include a comprehensive suite of ECM and threat warning avionics, plus six 23mm guns. A Bee Hind fire control radar directs the two guns mounted in the tail turret.

Conceptually akin to the Rockwell B-1B Lancer in being a variable-geometry supersonic penetration bomber designed for the strategic role, the Tu-160 is thought to have entered service in 1987 after a first flight in December 1981.
This Soviet type is some 20% longer than the B-1B and offers both a higher maximum speed and a considerably greater unrefueled combat radius on a mission using high-level subsonic cruise, low-level transonic penetration and high-level supersonic attack. The sweep of the outer wing panels can be manually selected at angles of between 20 and 65 degrees, and these low-set wings are mounted at the outboard ends of fixed glove sections characterized by acutely swept leading edges nicely faired into the narrow-diameter fuselage, which is of circular section.
        
The warload is carried in two lower-fuselage weapons bays, each 32 ft 9.75 in (10.00 m) long and able to carry a rotary launcher. The primary weapons are free-fall nuclear bombs and/or Kh-55 (AS-15 &quot;Kent&quot;) subsonic cruise missiles that were to be replaced by BL-10 (AS-19 &quot;Koala&quot;) supersonic cruise missiles whose development was canceled in 1992, although an alternative is a variable number of Kh-15 or RKV-500B (AS-16 &quot;Kickback&quot; short-range attack missiles used for the defense-suppression role.
Production of the Tu-160 was halted in the first half of the 1990s as the type was suffering a large number of in-service problems, was expensive to build and to maintain, and was largely superfluous to the strategic requirements of the CIS. The dissolution of the U.S.S.R. into the CIS left the force of 31 aircraft divided as 12 for Russia and 19 for the Ukraine. The latter lacks the ability to maintain its aircraft, which are now largely unserviceable and are scheduled for transfer to Russia.

The Type 10 is a next generation main battle tank of JSDF produced by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for the Japanese Ground Self Defense Force. Compared with other currently-serving main battle tanks in the JGSDF, the Type 10 has been equipped with enhancements in its capability to respond to anti-tank warfare and other contingencies.
       
The TK-X (MBT-X) project aims to produce the new Type 10 main battle tank, to replace or complement the existing Type 74 and Type 90 main battle tanks that are currently in service with the Japan Ground Self Defense Force. Development began in the 1990s, and production was expected to start in 20102011. A prototype was revealed on February 13, 2008 at the Technology Research and Development Institute (TRDI) in Sagamihara. Heavy emphasis was placed on C4I capabilities as well as on performance, firepower, protection and mobility.

The Type 16 maneuver combat vehicle (MCV) equips designated combat units. Due to its light weight and small size, it is designed for easy deployment (by aircraft if needed) allowing rapid movement on narrow roads and in built-up areas in response to various contingencies. Despite its small size and light armor, it can successfully attack much larger armored fighting vehicles as well as personnel, using its large caliber gun.
        
For FY2016, the MOD has requested funding for 36 examples of the MCV, to enter service with elements of the 8th Division at Kumamoto, and the 14th Brigade at Zentsuji. Both formations are currently planned for conversion to rapid reaction forces (though these plans, as with the original plans for the MCV , are presently (mid-2015) under review and subject to possible major revision). The intention is for the MCV to act as both as a rapid reaction asset against conventional incursions on the outer islands and as a counter-insurgency vehicle against asymmetrical attacks in urban areas of Japan by enemy special forces, intelligence operatives, or their proxies.
        
MCVs are expected to be highly functional, but can also be loaded on Kawasaki C-2 at the same time. JPSDF is dedicated to securing transport vessels for maritime transport independently, and will be carried on these vessels and transported to the Okinawa Islands.
        
Although the vehicle uses modular armor, it has a relatively delicate undercarriage and drive system that may be vulnerable to improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and other underbody blasts (such as from anti-tank mines). Since the MCV is designed only for defending against enemy invasion of the home islands, it is unlikely to find itself fighting a lengthy counter-insurgency campaign in a foreign nation, or encountering enemy minefields while spearheading an invasion of an enemy power.
      
The main gun is manually loaded as a cost-saving measure. Some critics have expressed doubts about its effectiveness due to this strain on the crew in hot conditions, as the vehicle does not have air conditioning. Concerns have also been expressed by some about what they perceive as a shortfall in the MCV's off-road capability.
        
In 2009 resistance testing of the shielding against HEAT rounds was conducted using the Carl Gustav M2; and against regular kinetic ammunition the frontal shield was developed to resist shots from 20 mm to 30 mm autocannons while the side armor was deemed sufficient to resist 12.7 mm heavy machine gun fire.

U-2A: In the first half of the 1950s, the USA was shocked from its assumption of overall technological superiority over the U.S.S.R. by the detonation of the first Soviet thermonuclear weapon in August 1953, and then by the appearance in May 1954 of a delivery system for this weapon in the form of the Myasishchyev M-4 &quot;Bison&quot; heavy bomber. Both these events came as complete surprises, and it was an ineluctable conclusion that American strategic reconnaissance needed new capability if the shock of such events was not to be repeated.
The key to the required capability came in the development at about this time of new high-resolution cameras, advanced lenses and Mylar-based film by Dr. Edwin Land, the Hycon Corporation and Eastman respectively. In concert, these offered the possibility of a very advanced aerial reconnaissance capability, and thoughts now turned to the type of platform that would be needed not only to use this capability but also to take maximum advantage of it. Current reconnaissance aircraft of the electronic and optical types lacked the altitude performance to operate above the ceiling of the interceptors whose endeavors made impossible all but the briefest forays in Soviet airspace, so it was clear from an early stage that long overflights would require a platform able to operate at extremely high altitude and so avoid the attentions of Soviet interceptors.
Although not invited to tender to the specification, Lockheed knew of its existence and as a private venture planned a development of its F-104 Starfighter high-altitude interceptor as the CL-282. This was designed to take-off from a jettisonable dolly (the subsequent landing being effected on extendible skids) and, with a powerplant of one General Electric J73-GE-X52 turbojet rated at 9,300 lb st (41.37 kN) dry, was expected to be capable of attaining a high altitude as a result of its long wing, which spanned 70 ft 8 in (21.54 m) with an aspect ratio of 9.99 and an area of 500.00 sq ft (46.45 sq m).
        
The U.S.A.F. rejected the design, but a presidential committee then decided that the RB-57D lacked the required range and that the X-16 was too great a technical risk. In November 1954, therefore, the CIA secured presidential approval to replace the X-16 with the proposal from Lockheed, which promised a prototype within eight months.
Lockheed entrusted development of the CL-282 into a more capable type to a team headed by Clarence &quot;Kelly&quot; Johnson of the company&apos;s Advanced Developments Projects department located at the &quot;Skunk Works&quot; secret design and construction facility in Burbank, California. The team&apos;s main task was to provide longer range and greater operating altitude. To this end the fuselage was redesigned as a lengthened unit with greater internal fuel capacity and the more powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney J57-P-37 turbojet rated at 10,500 lb st (46.71 kN) dry, and the wing was farther extended to 80 ft (24.38 m) for the higher aspect ratio of 11.33 and greater area of 565.00 sq ft (52.49 sq m). Weight-saving features included a very light structure, including a wing that weighed a mere 3 lbs/sq ft (14.6 kg/sq m), only about one-third of the figure for conventional jet aircraft, an S-1010B full-pressure pilot&apos;s suit to avoid the need for cabin pressurization, a conventional seat rather than an ejector seat though such a seat was later fitted and, in place of the CL-282&apos;s skid landing gear, a retractable but lightweight bicycle combination, which comprised twin-wheel main and tail units in tandem under the fuselage, underwing outrigger units that provided stability during the take-off run but were dropped after lift-off, and down-turned wing tips to serve as the skids onto which the wing could subside as it lost lateral control during the last stages of the landing run.
The type was designated in the U-for-utility series to disguise its real role, and the prototype first flew in August 1955. It soon became clear that the U-2 offered exceptional capabilities, and the initial CIA order was soon complemented by a U.S.A.F. contract. Although early aircraft retained the prototype&apos;s J57-P-37 engine, later aircraft were powered by the J57-P-37A turbojet, rated at 11,200 lb st (49.82 kN) dry. The internal fuel capacity was 785 U.S. gal (653.7 Imp gal; 2,971.5 liters), supplemented by 210 U.S. gal (174.9 Imp gal; 794.9 liters) in two non-jettisonable slipper tanks on the wing leading edges, and up to 750 lbs (340 kg) of reconnaissance equipment could be installed in the &quot;Q-bay&quot; immediately behind the cockpit.
As the type&apos;s service career progressed, the surviving aircraft sprouted a number of additional antennae and a radome associated with extra reconnaissance systems. A number of the U.S.A.F.&apos;s U-2A aircraft were later revised to WU-2A standard for the atmospheric research and radiation sampling roles, the latter characterized by a large port-side air scoop beneath the equipment bay.
        
U-2B: This model was introduced in 1959, probably for use only by the CIA, although possibly by Taiwan at a later date, as a development of the U-2A with integral wing tanks and a new powerplant in the form of the Pratt &amp; Whitney J75 turbojet to restore the range and ceiling that had been lost by the U-2A as additional equipment was added. The new tanks raised internal fuel capacity to 1,140 US gal (949.25 Imp gal; 4,315.4 liters), and while early aircraft had the J75-P-13 turbojet, rated at 15,800 lb st (70.28 kN) dry, later aircraft were powered by the J75-P-13B, rated at 17,000 lb st (75.62 kN) dry.
The type was also more difficult to fly than the already tricky U-2A, for the additional weight of the engine and fuel meant that at high altitude the stalling speed was only 4 kts (4.6 mph; 7.4 km/h) below the airframe&apos;s limiting Mach number, requiring the pilot to operate within an extraordinarily narrow speed band if his machine was not to enter either of two buffet zones.
Production of the U-2A and U-2B is thought to have totaled at least 48 machines in the form of 20 aircraft for the CIA and 28 aircraft for the U.S.A.F.
        
U-2C: An unknown number of this model was produced in the early 1960s as U-2B conversions for the COMINT and ELINT roles. The powerplant of one J75-P-13B engine was standard, with greater airflow provided by enlarged inlets, and the fuel arrangement was revised to provide an internal capacity of 1,320 US gal (1,099.1 Imp gal; 4,996.7 liters) within a total capacity of 1,530 US gal (1,274 Imp gal; 5,791.7 liters) with the slipper tanks. The nose was lengthened slightly for additional mission equipment, and further volume was provided by the installation of a long dorsal &quot;canoe&quot; fairing. The total mission equipment weight was 1,450 lbs (658 kg), comprising 750 lbs (340 kg) in the &quot;Q-bay&quot;, 100 lbs (45 kg) in the &quot;canoe&quot; fairing, and 600 lbs (272 kg) in the two wing pods.
Typical data for the U-2C included a span of 80 ft (24.38 m) with an aspect ratio of 11.33 and an area of 565.00 sq ft (52.49 sq m), a length of 50 ft (15.24 m), a height of 15 ft (4.57 m), a maximum take-off weight of 22,542 lbs (10,225 kg), a cruising speed of 400 kts (461 mph; 741 km/h) at 65,000 ft (19810 m), a range of 2,500 nm (2,879 miles; 4,633 km), an endurance of 6 hours, and an operating altitude of 70,000 ft (21,335 m).
Later in the type&apos;s career, one U-2C was converted into a dual-control trainer model as the U-2C(T) with the instructor&apos;s cockpit inserted behind and above the standard cockpit, and the outrigger &quot;pogo&quot; wheels retained in flight.
        
U-2E: This designation was applied to an unknown number of U-2A and U-2B conversions for CIA use with improved ECM capability.
        
U-2F: This designation was applied to an unknown number of U-2A conversions with an in-flight refueling receptacle in the port wing. Two of the aircraft were further modified with &quot;ram&apos;s horn&quot; antennae for use in the SIGINT role during the Vietnam War (American involvement between 1961 and 1973).
        
U-2G: Under this designation, two U-2Cs were fitted with arrester hooks for carrier compatibility trials.
        
U-2J: This designation may have been applied to a small number of carrier-compatible conversions employed operationally by the CIA.
        
U-2R: This was the final production model of the U-2, and was developed in the mid-1960s to overcome the basic U-2 series&apos; mismatch of engine and airframe. The U-2R thus resembles its predecessors in external configuration though with larger overall dimensions, but internally it is a virtually new and completely restressed design carefully matched to the J75 engine. First flown in August 1967 and produced in 1969 and 1970, the 12 aircraft of the U-2R production batch have greater structural strength, an increased-span wing, much increased fuel capacity, an improved cockpit with a zero/zero ejector seat for a pilot wearing the S-1031 full-pressure suit, and handling characteristics considerably improved over those of the earlier models.
        
The type carries five 70 mm cameras for high-resolution photographic reconnaissance, and large pods can be mounted on the wings for additional reconnaissance equipment in a feature carried over to the TR-1 series. There are also at least two U-2Rs configured for the COMINT role with a large dorsal radome containing the equipment for real-time transmission for data via a satellite to the relevant analysis facility.
These original U-2R aircraft differ from the later U-2R (originally TR-1A) aircraft in a length of 62 ft 11 in (19.17 m), an empty weight of 15,100 lbs (6,848 kg), a maximum take-off weight of 41,000 lbs (18,597 kg), a maximum range of about 5,428 nm (6,250 miles; 10,060 km), and a service ceiling of 80,000 ft (24,385 m).
Two of the U-2Rs were loaned to the U.S. Navy for temporary conversion to the U-2EP-X configuration for evaluation of the EP-X (Electronic Patrol - Experimental) role with a slightly shorter nose and slipper payload pods that did not project to the rear of the wing trailing edges. The type had a different avionics suite that included a FLIR sensor.
One other U-2R was converted to U-2R(T) two-seat trainer standard.

The UAZ-469 is an off-road military light utility vehicle manufactured by UAZ. It was used by Soviet and other Warsaw Pact armed forces, as well as paramilitary units in Eastern Bloc countries. In the Soviet Union, it also saw widespread service in state organizations that needed a robust and durable off-road vehicle. Standard military versions included seating for seven personnel.
                
Developed from the GAZ-69 and UAZ-460,[3] the UAZ-469 was introduced in 1971 to replace the GAZ-69. It was powered by the same 75 hp (56 kW; 76 PS) 2,445 cc (149.2 cu in) UMZ 452MI inline-four engine as the UAZ-452 and was able to run on gasoline with an octane rating as low as 72 (although 76 was preferred). The UAZ-469 presented two great advantages: it was able to drive in virtually any terrain and it was very easy to repair. The vehicle was originally not available for purchase by the public, but many were sold as surplus to private owners.

Modifications include a basic UAZ-469B with ground clearance of 220 mm (8.7 in), and a specialized military UAZ-469, with ground clearance increased to 300 mm (12 in). After slight modernisation in 1985, due to new industry designation standards, they were renamed: the UAZ-469 became the UAZ-3151, while the UAZ-469B became the &quot;UAZ-31512&quot;. Manufacture of the UAZ-31512 for the Russian Army continued until 2011, while manufacture for the civilian market was discontinued due to new emission standards. However, the currently manufactured UAZ Hunter is an updated version of the old UAZ-469B.The Hunter was originally sold in Germany and some Asian countries as the &quot;UAZ Tigr&quot; (Tiger), until General Motors complained that the name was too similar to the Opel Tigra, and in Germany, it was renamed &quot;Baijah Taigah&quot;.
                
The 469 was exported to eighty countries.
                
It was used by Soviet and other Warsaw Pact armed forces, as well as paramilitary units in Eastern Bloc countries. In the Soviet Union, it also saw widespread service in state organizations that needed a robust and durable off-road vehicle. Standard military versions included seating for seven personnel.

While the UH-1N could be used to drop troops into combat zones, its lack of armament and armor make it better suited for Special Operations missions. It can also be configured to transport cargo to help in supply operations. Because of the unique type of missions this helicopter engages in and its complete lack of defenses, it must avoid detection to survive.

The Black Hawk has been the U.S. Army&apos;s standard transport helicopter since it entered service in 1979. The UH-60L is moderately armored and its engine is able to function for up to 30 minutes after it has lost all its oil. Its avionics include Doppler radar as well as infrared countermeasures and a radar warning receiver. Armed versions can carry as many as 32 Hellfire anti-tank missiles. Transport Black Hawks are used extensively for air mobility, resupply, and medevac duties. As with most helicopters, the Black Hawk has little to no air-to-air combat ability. Black Hawk pilots count on allied fighters for air defense. Without such aid, Hawk pilots must fly low to evade enemy aircraft and thereby risk ground fire.

The Virginia-class nuclear guided-missile cruisers, also known as the CGN-38 class, were a series of four double-ended (with missile armament carried both fore and aft) nuclear-powered guided-missile cruisers commissioned in the late 1970s to 1980, which served in the United States Navy until the mid-to-late 1990s. They were the final class of nuclear-powered cruisers completed and the last ships ordered as Destroyer Leaders under the pre-1975 classification system.
           
The ships had relatively short service lives. As with any nuclear-powered ship, they were expensive to operate. The class was just coming up for their mid-life reactor refuelings when the 1994 Defense Authorization Bill was being formulated, which would effect cuts of 38% to the Navy's budget, compared to the 1993 bill. The $300-million-plus cost of each refueling and other upgrades made the class easy targets for decommissioning. Each ship was therefore retired starting with Texas in July 1993 and ending with Arkansas in 1998; all went through the nuclear vessel decommissioning and recycling program.

VTT-323 (M1973 Sinhung) Armored Personnel Carrier (APC)
The M1973 Sinhung VTT-323 is a licensed North Korean copy of the Chinese NORINCO YW 531 Armored Personnel Carrier.
                
When the North Korean Army needed an armored personnel carrier, they turned to what they do best - license production of an existing (and proven) system from one of their few global allies, the Chinese. The VTT-323 (M1973 &quot;Sinhung&quot;) was born as a locally-produced copy of the NORINCO YW 531C series armored personnel carrier. As such, the VTT-323 shares much in common with the original Chinese offering and grows the mobility and reach of North Korean land forces even further. The VTT-323 has since become the standard North Korean Army Armored Personnel Carrier and would no doubt be fielded in force during an invasion scenario involving South Korea. It is assumed that the VTT-323 began operational service with the North Korean People&apos;s Army (NKPA) sometime in 1973.
                
Design of the VTT-323 naturally follows the original Chinese form. The welded steel hull features a boxy appearance with slab-sides, a flat roof, pointed bow and a squared-off rear section. The turret, containing the base armament, is situated just to the rear of the vehicle center along the hull roof and sports well-sloped sides. The VTT-323 showcases two individual track systems on each hull side made up of four rubber-tired road wheels each. The drive sprocket is found at the front of the hull sides with the track idler located at the rear. Interestingly, there are no track return rollers in the design. Light armor &quot;skirting&quot; protects only the upper regions of the road wheels and track system. There is a rectangular entry/exit hatch located at the rear hull facing hinged to open right. The engine compartment is fitted to the center-front right of the hull with the driver located at the front left and another position hatch to the driver&apos;s right. Another hatch is observed to the driver&apos;s rear, most likely the commander&apos;s position. There are hatches found at the rear of the hull roof as well, these behind the turret system. The forward hull is protected by a well-sloped glacis plate. Power is supplied by a single V-8, air-cooled, turbocharged diesel engine delivering 320 horsepower at 2,500rpm. Maximum road speed is equal to 65 km/h with a maximum range of 500 km. Combat weight is about 12,600 kg.
                
The VTT-323 is operated by a standard crew of four personnel made up of the driver, commander, gunner and loader. In addition to the operating crew, the VTT-323 can carry up to 10 combat-ready troops to hotspots in relative safety and comfort. The base armament arrangement is centralized in a powered turret featuring 360-degree traverse and some capable elevation to engage higher-placed targets such as low-flying aircraft. The primary weapon system is a 14.5mm anti-aircraft heavy machine gun coupled with a 7.62mm general purpose anti-infantry machine gun mount - both are situated in the turret controlled by the gunner. Additionally, the armament can consist of a pairing of two 14.5mm heavy machine gun systems for optimal effect. Some VTT-323 systems are known to mount the Soviet AT-3 &quot;Sagger&quot; anti-tank missile launcher (known to the North Koreans as the &quot;Susong-Po&quot;) to help defend itself from enemy armor.
                
Like the original Chinese APC, the VTT-323 is fully amphibious though requiring some initial preparation by the crew before undergoing the process. A trim vane is raised and bilge pumps are switch on. Propulsion is then handled simply by the rotational movement of the vehicle&apos;s own tracks in the water.
                
The VTT-323 chassis is adaptable enough to mount a variety of fire support weapons that include a 82mm mortar and 107mm Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) - the latter mounted to the rear of the turret assembly itself. Additionally, some base VTT-323 are known to mount Soviet-style short-ranged, low-altitude surface-to-air missile systems for immediate airspace self-defense. If the Chinese YW 531C is any indication of adaptability, the VTT-323 chassis can be further evolved into dedicated battlefield support systems such as battlefield ambulance, command post vehicle and self-propelled guns. Being it that the VTT-323 now resides as the primary APC of the NKPA, this is not out of the realm of possibility. North Korea&apos;s PT-85 amphibious light tank features a lengthened chassis based on the VTT-323 armored personnel carrier.
                
TheVTT-323 series may also be known under the nickname of &quot;VET&quot;.

The WZ-551 is a Chinese wheeled armored personnel carrier. It is actually consisted of two families of vehicles with official designations in the People&apos;s Liberation Army as Type 90 and Type 92. Roughly 900 WZ-551s are in service with the PLA, where they are used by light mechanized infantry units. WZ-551s have been exported to Algeria, Bosnia, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Pakistan and Senegal.
                
Produced by Norinco, the WZ-551 first appeared in 1984, but the Chinese military were not satisfied with its performance, and the design had to be modified. Modification is mostly concentrated on improving the chassis. The improved WZ-551A entered service in 1995 as the Type 92 IFV and Type 92A APC.
                
It has a crew of three men, and is fully amphibious, being driven in the water by shrouded propellers. Constructed of welded steel plates, the interior is divided into three compartments. The driver and commander sit in the front, the engine is in the middle, and the passengers, equipment or turret basket is located in the rear. The automotive platform is a modified Chinese-made Tiema XC2030 6X6 truck, which is based on the conventional Mercedes-Benz 2026 truck.
                
The IFV version is equipped with a 25 mm cannon and a 7.62 mm coaxial machine gun in a closed turret and it can carry 9 passengers. The APC version has only a 12.7 mm machine gun but can carry 11 passengers. Additional versions include anti-tank missile, command, self-propelled artillery, air defense and armored recovery vehicles.

The YJ-12 is an air-launched missile that resembles a lengthened Kh-31 and is close in shape to the GQM-163 Coyote aerial target.
       
A 2011 article in the United States Naval War College Review credited the &quot;YJ-91/YJ-12&quot; with a range of 400 km and a 205 kg high explosive warhead, compared to the 130 km (81 mi; 70 nmi) range of a Harpoon anti-ship missile. Furthermore, an aircraft could launch the &quot;YJ-91/YJ-12&quot; while still 230 km beyond the range of SM-2 and Sparrow anti-air missiles, which have ranges of less than 170 km. According to Chinese sources, the YJ-12 has a speed of around Mach 2 if launched from low altitude and up to Mach 3.2 if launched from high altitude, with a maximum range of around 380 km (240 mi; 210 nmi) depending on launch altitude; terminal attack altitude is 15 meters. In a September 2014 article published in Joint Forces Quarterly, the missile was credited with a range of up to 250 km and a speed of Mach 2.5. In February 2015, military expert Li Li claimed the YJ-12 has a 400500 kg (8801,100 lb) warhead and a range of 300 km (190 mi; 160 nmi) when traveling at Mach 3, or 400 km at a speed of Mach 4. Speed and range varies on launch altitude and flight path, achieving maximum performance at an altitude of 40 km (130,000 ft) and degrading as it gets lower. Although actual warhead weight may be roughly 200 kg, its supersonic speed enables lethality equivalent to a subsonic missile equipped with a 400500 kg warhead. The YJ-12 can also do evasive maneuvers to avoid anti-missile threats. 
         
A saturation attack by YJ-12's fired at long range would pose a grave threat to American carrier strike groups; once the wave of sea-skimming missiles appeared over the horizon and was detected by ships' own sensors, they would only have some 45 seconds to engage before impact and if there were enough, short range defenses would be overwhelmed. Given that fighters such as the Su-30MKK and J-11B have a combat radius of about 1,500 km, equipping them with the YJ-12 gives them a potential strike range out to 1,900 km (1,200 mi; 1,000 nmi). The U.S. Navy's counter is to use the Cooperative Engagement Capability to detect and destroy the YJ-12's launch aircraft with SM-6 missiles and fighters at long range before they can be fired.
        
It has been test-launched from Xian H-6 bombers[11] and will be fitted on the JH-7B.Reportedly, they may also be launched from the J-10, Su-30MKK, the J-11, and J-16.

The YW531 is a Chinese armoured personnel carrier that entered service in the late 1960s. It was the first armoured vehicle designed in China without Soviet assistance. The design is simple and is comparable to other APCs of its time such as the M113.
                
Approximately 8,000 all types and variants were produced by Norinco, making it the third most widely manufactured AFV in the world. It also equips several armies around the world and has seen action in different conflicts including the Vietnam War, the Sino-Vietnamese War, the IranIraq War, and the Gulf War.

The ZIL-135 is a large, eight-wheeled military transport and self-propelled artillery truck produced in the Cold War by the Soviet Union starting in 1959. Its purpose was to carry and launch an artillery missile, specifically a FROG-7, from surface-to-surface. The ZIL-135 was widely exported to other communist countries, most notably North Korea, where it is a common sight in films and military marches. It also served as the TEL for the BM-27 Uragan artillery rocket system.

The ZPU-2 is the twin version of the ZPU-1 anti-aircraft gun, mounted on two different types of carriage. For the older one, the wheels have to be removed when the gun is brought into firing position. The newer one, which is similar to that of the ZU-23, doesn&apos;t has to be it&apos;s wheels removed. Instead, the wheels are raised. In both cases the ZPU-2 rests on a three-point plattform when firing.

The Type 58 AAA is the chinese variant of the ZPU-2. It carries the KPV machine guns of the Type 56 AAA.

The ZSU-23-4 is a proven threat against aircraft. Its four cannons are able to fire up to 1,000 rounds a minute. Couples with its radar tracking, all weather capability, and its ability to acquire and fire upon targets on the move, the Shilka can be deadly to any aircraft within its 1,750-yd. range. The Shilka is particularly effective when used in combination with SAMs, which force the opposing aircraft to a lower altitude where the cannons are much more effective. The Shilka was designed to replace the ZSU-57-2.

Introduced in the 1950s, the Zsu-57-2 is of limited use at best. It has an open turret that provides virtually no protection for the gun crew, can only perform during the day in good weather and only has optical targeting, which renders it extremely inaccurate. The only advantages to this vehicle are the large size of its guns, which can smash most aircraft (provided it hits them), and its 4,300-yd. range. Nonetheless, it has proved to be highly ineffective and has been replaced in most areas by the superior ZSU-23-4.

The ZU-23 is a towed anti-aircraft gun that can double as an anti-tank weapon as well. Its performance against aircraft is seriously limited by its complete lack of radar or any other targeting system. As a result, it is only useful against low-flying aircraft in good weather. The same problem affects it when used against ground targets. Since visible targeting is the only option, even a simple smokescreen can render it useless.
